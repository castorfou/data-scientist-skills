# ## Which pattern?
# Which of the following Regex patterns results in the following text?
# 
# ![image.png](attachment:image.png)

# In the IPython Shell, try replacing PATTERN with one of the below options and observe the resulting output. The re module has been pre-imported for you and my_string is available in your namespace.

import re
my_string = "Let's write RegEx!"
re.findall(r"\w+", my_string)


# ## Practicing regular expressions: re.split() and re.findall()
# Now you'll get a chance to write some regular expressions to match digits, strings and non-alphanumeric characters. Take a look at my_string first by printing it in the IPython Shell, to determine how you might best match the different steps.
# 
# Note: It's important to prefix your regex patterns with r to ensure that your patterns are interpreted in the way you want them to. Else, you may encounter problems to do with escape sequences in strings. For example, "\n" in Python is used to indicate a new line, but if you use the r prefix, it will be interpreted as the raw string "\n" - that is, the character "\" followed by the character "n" - and not as a new line.
# 
# The regular expression module re has already been imported for you.
# 
# Remember from the video that the syntax for the regex library is to always to pass the pattern first, and then the string second.

King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!\nSOLDIER #1: Pull the other one!\nARTHUR: I am, ...  and this is my trusty servant Patsy.  We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.  I must speak with your lord and master.\nSOLDIER #1: What?  Ridden on a horse?\nARTHUR: Yes!\nSOLDIER #1: You're using coconuts!\nARTHUR: What?\nSOLDIER #1: You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.\nARTHUR: So?

They could be carried.\nSOLDIER #1: What?  A swallow carrying a coconut?\nARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!\nSOLDIER #1: It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.\nARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.\nSOLDIER #1: Listen.  In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?\nARTHUR: Please!\nSOLDIER #1: Am I right?\nARTHUR: I'm not interested!\nSOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!\nSOLDIER #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow.  That's my point.\nSOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that.\nARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!\nSOLDIER #1: But then of course a-- African swallows are non-migratory.\nSOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah...\nSOLDIER #1: So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...

'cause they're made of...  wood?\nBEDEVERE: Good!  Heh heh.\nCROWD: Oh yeah.  Oh.\nBEDEVERE: So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?\nVILLAGER #1: Build a bridge out of her.\nBEDEVERE: Ah, but can you not also make bridges out of stone?\nVILLAGER #1: Oh, yeah.\nRANDOM: Oh, yeah.

I would be honored.\nARTHUR: What is your name?\nBEDEVERE: Bedevere, my liege.\nARTHUR: Then I dub you Sir Bedevere, Knight of the Round Table\nNARRATOR: The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir Lancelot the Brave; Sir Gallahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol, and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.  Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries: the Knights of the Round Table\nSCENE 6: [clop clop clop] \nSIR BEDEVERE: And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped.\nARTHUR: This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.\nBEDEVERE: Oh, certainly, sir.\nSIR LAUNCELOT: Look, my liege! [trumpets] \nARTHUR: Camelot!\nSIR GALAHAD: Camelot!\nLAUNCELOT: Camelot!\nPATSY: It's only a model.\nARTHUR: Shh!  Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.  Let us ride... to...  Camelot! [in medieval hall] \nKNIGHTS: [singing] We're knights of the round table.  We dance when e'er we're able.  We do routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable.  We dine well here in Camelot.  We eat ham and jam and spam a lot [dancing] We're knights of the Round Table. Our shows are formidable, But many times we're given rhymes That are quite unsingable. We're opera mad in Camelot. We sing from the diaphragm a lot [in dungeon] \nPRISONER: [clap clap clap clap] [in medieval hall] \nKNIGHTS: [tap-dancing] In war we're tough and able, Quite indefatigable.  Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable.  It's a busy life in Camelot.\nMAN: I have to push the pram a lot [outdoors] \nARTHUR: Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot.  It is a silly place.\nKNIGHTS: Right.  Right\nSCENE 7: [clop clop clop] [boom boom] [angels sing] \nGOD: Arthur!  Arthur, King of the Britons!  Oh, don't grovel! [singing stops] One thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.\nARTHUR: Sorry. [boom] \nGOD: And don't apologise.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's 'sorry this' and 'forgive me that' and 'I'm not worthy'. [boom] What are you doing now?!\nARTHUR: I'm averting my eyes, O Lord.\nGOD: Well, don't.  It's like those miserable Psalms-- they're so depressing. Now knock it off!\nARTHUR: Yes, Lord.\nGOD: Right!  Arthur, King of the Britons, your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.\nARTHUR: Good idea, O Lord!\nGOD: 'Course it's a good idea!  Behold! [angels sing] Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.  Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.  That is your purpose, Arthur...  the quest for the Holy Grail. [boom] [singing stops] \nLAUNCELOT: A blessing!  A blessing from the Lord!\nGALAHAD: God be praised\nSCENE 8: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] \nARTHUR: Halt! [horn] Hallo! [pause] Hallo!\nFRENCH GUARD: Allo!  Who is eet?\nARTHUR: It is King Arthur, and these are my Knights of the Round Table.  Who's castle is this?\nFRENCH GUARD: This is the castle of my master Guy de Loimbard.\nARTHUR: Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest.  If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.\nFRENCH GUARD: Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen.  Uh, he's already got one, you see?\nARTHUR: What?\nGALAHAD: He says they've already got one!\nARTHUR: Are you sure he's got one?\nFRENCH GUARD: Oh, yes, it's very nice-a.  (I told him we already got one.)\nARTHUR: Well, u-- um, can we come up and have a look?\nFRENCH GUARD: Of course not!  You are English types-a!\nARTHUR: Well, what are you then?\nFRENCH GUARD: I'm French!  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king-a?!\nGALAHAD: What are you doing in England?\nFRENCH GUARD: Mind your own business!\nARTHUR: If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force!\nFRENCH GUARD: You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!  Go and boil your bottom, sons of a silly person.  I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King, you and all your silly English k-nnnnniggets.  Thpppppt!  Thppt! Thppt!\nGALAHAD: What a strange person.\nARTHUR: Now look here, my good man--\nFRENCH GUARD: I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough wiper!  I fart in your general direction!  You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!\nGALAHAD: Is there someone else up there we could talk to?\nFRENCH GUARD: No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a! [sniff] \nARTHUR: Now, this is your last chance.  I've been more than reasonable.\nFRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache.)\nOTHER FRENCH GUARD: Quoi?\nFRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache!) [mooo] \nARTHUR: If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall-- [twong] [mooooooo] Jesus Christ!\nKNIGHTS: Christ! [thud] Ah!  Ohh!\nARTHUR: Right!  Charge!\nKNIGHTS: Charge!

Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!\nARTHUR: Who leaps out?\nBEDEVERE: U-- u-- uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I.  Uh, leap out of the rabbit, uh, and uh...\nARTHUR: Ohh.\nBEDEVERE: Oh.

Haw haw heh..\nSCENE 9: [clack] \nVOICE: Picture for Schools, take eight.\nDIRECTOR: Action!\nHISTORIAN: Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur.  The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. [clop clop clop] Now, this is what they did: Launcelot--\nKNIGHT: Aaaah! [slash] [KNIGHT kills HISTORIAN] \nHISTORIAN'S WIFE: Frank\nSCENE 10: [trumpets] \nNARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Robin.  So each of the knights went their separate ways.  Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels.\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot.  He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin.  He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.  Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!  He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp, Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.  To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away, And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!\nHis head smashed in and his heart cut out, And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged, And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off, And his pen--\nSIR ROBIN: That's-- that's, uh-- that's enough music for now, lads.  Heh.  Looks like there's dirty work afoot.\nDENNIS: Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.\nWOMAN: Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom.  We haven't got enough mud.\nALL HEADS: Halt!  Who art thou?\nMINSTREL: [singing] He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who--\nROBIN: Shut up!  Um, n-- n-- n-- nobody really, I'm j-- j-- j-- ju-- just um, just passing through.\nALL HEADS: What do you want?\nMINSTREL: [singing] To fight and--\nROBIN: Shut up!  Um, oo, a-- nothing, nothing really.  I, uh, j-- j-- just--just to um, just to p-- pass through, good Sir Knight.\nALL HEADS: I'm afraid not!\nROBIN: Ah.  W-- well, actually I-- I am a Knight of the Round Table.\nALL HEADS: You're a Knight of the Round Table?\nROBIN: I am.\nLEFT HEAD: In that case I shall have to kill you.\nMIDDLE HEAD: Shall I?\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, I don't think so.\nMIDDLE HEAD: Well, what do I think?\nLEFT HEAD: I think kill him.\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, let's be nice to him.\nLEFT HEAD: Oh shut up.\nROBIN: Perhaps I could--\nLEFT HEAD: And you.  Oh, quick!  Get the sword out.  I want to cut his headoff!\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, cut your own head off!\nMIDDLE HEAD: Yes, do us all a favor!\nLEFT HEAD: What?\nRIGHT HEAD: Yapping on all the time.\nMIDDLE HEAD: You're lucky.  You're not next to him.\nLEFT HEAD: What do you mean?\nMIDDLE HEAD: You snore!\nLEFT HEAD: Oh, I don't.  Anyway, you've got bad breath.\nMIDDLE HEAD: Well it's only because you don't brush my teeth.\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh stop bitching and let's go have tea.\nLEFT HEAD: Oh, all right.  All right.  All right.  We'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits.\nMIDDLE HEAD: Yes.\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, not biscuits.\nLEFT HEAD: All right.  All right, not biscuits, but let's kill him anyway.\nALL HEADS: Right!\nMIDDLE HEAD: He buggered off.\nRIGHT HEAD: So he has.  He's scarper\nMINSTREL: [singing] Brave Sir Robin ran away.\nROBIN: No!\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravely ran away away.\nROBIN: I didn't!\nMINSTREL: [singing] When danger reared its ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled.\nROBIN: No!\nMINSTREL: [singing] Yes, brave Sir Robin turned about\nROBIN: I didn't!\nMINSTREL: [singing] And gallantly he chickened out, bravely taking to his feet.\nROBIN: I never did!\nMINSTREL: [singing] He beat a very brave retreat.\nROBIN: All lies!\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin.\nROBIN: I never\nCARTOON MONKS: [chanting] Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Heh heh heeh ooh...

Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.\nGALAHAD: The Castle Anthrax?\nZOOT: Yes.  Oh, it's not a very good name is it?  Oh, but we are nice and we will attend to your every, every need!\nGALAHAD: You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?\nZOOT: The what?\nGALAHAD: The Grail.  It is here.\nZOOT: Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile.  Midget!  Crapper!\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Yes, O Zoot?\nZOOT: Prepare a bed for our guest.\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Oh thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you! ...\nZOOT: Away, away varletesses.  The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big.\nGALAHAD: Well, look, I-- I-- uh--\nZOOT: What is your name, handsome knight?\nGALAHAD: Sir Galahad...  the Chaste.\nZOOT: Mine is Zoot.  Just Zoot.  Oh, but come.\nGALAHAD: Look, please!  In God's name, show me the Grail!\nZOOT: Oh, you have suffered much.  You are delirious.\nGALAHAD: No, look.  I have seen it!  It is here, in this--\nZOOT: Sir Galahad!  You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.\nGALAHAD: Well, I-- I-- uh--\nZOOT: Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life: bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.  We are just not used to handsome knights.  Nay.  Nay.  Come.  Come.  You may lie here.  Oh, but you are wounded!\nGALAHAD: No, no-- it's-- it's nothing.\nZOOT: Oh, you must see the doctors immediately!  No, no, please!  Lie down. [clap clap] \nPIGLET: Well, what seems to be the trouble?\nGALAHAD: They're doctors?!\nZOOT: Uh, they have a basic medical training, yes.\nGALAHAD: B-- but--\nZOOT: Oh, come, come.  You must try to rest.  Doctor Piglet!  Doctor Winston!  Practice your art.\nWINSTON: Try to relax.\nGALAHAD: Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?\nPIGLET: We must examine you.\nGALAHAD: There's nothing wrong with that!\nPIGLET: Please.  We are doctors.\nGALAHAD: Look!  This cannot be.  I am sworn to chastity.\nPIGLET: Back to your bed!  At once!\nGALAHAD: Torment me no longer.  I have seen the Grail!\nPIGLET: There's no grail here.\nGALAHAD: I have seen it!  I have seen it! [clank] I have seen--\nGIRLS: Hello.\nGALAHAD: Oh.\nGIRLS: Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.

I have seen it, here in this castle!\nDINGO: Oh no.  Oh, no!  Bad, bad Zoot!\nGALAHAD: Well, what is it?\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting alight to our beacon, which, I have just remembered, is grail-shaped.  It's not the first time we've had this problem.\nGALAHAD: It's not the real Grail?\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!  She is a bad person and must pay the penalty.  Do you think this scene should have been cut?  We were so worried when the boys were writing it, but now, we're glad.  It's better than some of the previous scenes, I think.\nLEFT HEAD: At least ours was better visually.\nDENNIS: Well, at least ours was committed.  It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes.\nOLD MAN: Get on with it.\nTIM THE ENCHANTER: Yes, get on with it!\nARMY OF KNIGHTS: Yes, get on with it!\nDINGO: Oh, I am enjoying this scene.\nGOD: Get on with it!\nDINGO: [sigh] Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot.  Oh, she is a naughty person, and she must pay the penalty.  And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon.  You must tie her down on a bed and spank her.\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!\nDINGO: You must spank her well.  And after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like.  And then, spank me.\nAMAZING: And spank me.\nSTUNNER: And me.\nLOVELY: And me.\nDINGO: Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!  There is going to be a spanking tonight!\nDINGO: And after the spanking, the oral sex.\nGIRLS: The oral sex!  The oral sex!\nGALAHAD: Well, I could stay a bit longer.\nLAUNCELOT: Sir Galahad!\nGALAHAD: Oh, hello.\nLAUNCELOT: Quick!\nGALAHAD: What?\nLAUNCELOT: Quick!\nGALAHAD: Why?\nLAUNCELOT: You are in great peril!\nDINGO: No he isn't.\nLAUNCELOT: Silence, foul temptress!\nGALAHAD: You know, she's got a point.\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!  We will cover your escape!\nGALAHAD: Look, I'm fine!\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!\nGIRLS: Sir Galahad!\nGALAHAD: No.  Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!\nDINGO: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!\nGIRLS: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!\nLAUNCELOT: No, Sir Galahad.  Come on!\nGALAHAD: No!  Really!  Honestly, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily.\nDINGO: Oh, yes.  Let him handle us easily.\nGIRLS: Yes.  Let him handle us easily.\nLAUNCELOT: No.  Quick!  Quick!\nGALAHAD: Please!  I can defeat them!  There's only a hundred-and-fifty of them!\nDINGO: Yes, yes!  He will beat us easily!  We haven't a chance.\nGIRLS: We haven't a chance.  He will beat us easily... [boom] \nDINGO: Oh, shit.\nLAUNCELOT: We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.\nGALAHAD: I don't think I was.\nLAUNCELOT: Yes you were.  You were in terrible peril.\nGALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.\nLAUNCELOT: No, it's too perilous.\nGALAHAD: Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.\nLAUNCELOT: No, we've got to find the Holy Grail.  Come on!\nGALAHAD: Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?\nLAUNCELOT: No.  It's unhealthy.\nGALAHAD: I bet you're gay.\nLAUNCELOT: No I'm not\nNARRATOR: Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail.  Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something.  Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.  I mean, they were more than two laden swallows' flights away-- four, really, if they had a coconut on a line between them.  I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging--\nCROWD: Get on with it!\nNARRATOR: Oh, anyway.  On to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue, and in which there aren't any swallows, although I think you can hear a starling-- oooh\nSCENE 12:\nOLD MAN: Heh, hee ha ha hee hee!

The Grail is there?\nOLD MAN: There is much danger, for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed.\nARTHUR: But the Grail!  Where is the Grail?!\nOLD MAN: Seek you the Bridge of Death.\nARTHUR: The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail?\nOLD MAN: Heh, hee hee hee hee!  Ha ha ha ha ha!

Father.\nHERBERT: B-- b-- but Father, I don't want any of that.\nFATHER: Listen, lad.  I built this kingdom up from nothing.  When I started here, all there was was swamp.  Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em.  It sank into the swamp.  So, I built a second one.  That sank into the swamp.  So I built a third one.  That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp.  But the fourth one...  stayed up!  And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands.\nHERBERT: But I don't want any of that.  I'd rather--\nFATHER: Rather what?!\nHERBERT: I'd rather...

In twenty minutes you're getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.\nHERBERT: B-- but I don't want land.\nFATHER: Listen, Alice,--\nHERBERT: Herbert.\nFATHER: 'Erbert.  We live in a bloody swamp.  We need all the land we can get.\nHERBERT: But-- but I don't like her.\nFATHER: Don't like her?!  What's wrong with her?!  She's beautiful.  She's rich.  She's got huge...  tracts o' land.\nHERBERT: I know, but I want the-- the girl that I marry to have...  [music] ... a certain...  special...  something!\nFATHER: Cut that out!  Cut that out!  Look, you're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea! [smack] Guards!  Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.\nGUARD #1: Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.\nGUARD #2: Hic!\nFATHER: No, no.  Until I come and get him.\nGUARD #1: Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.\nFATHER: No, no.  No.  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.\nGUARD #1: And you'll come and get him.\nGUARD #2: Hic!\nFATHER: Right.\nGUARD #1: We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.\nFATHER: No, no.  Leaving the room.\nGUARD #1: Leaving the room.  Yes.

Alright?\nGUARD #2: Hic!\nFATHER: Right.\nGUARD #1: Oh, I remember.  Uhh, can he leave the room with us?\nFATHER: N-- no no.  No.  You just keep him in here, and make sure he--\nGUARD #1: Oh, yes.  We'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him--\nFATHER: No, no, no, no.  Just keep him in here--\nGUARD #1: Until you, or anyone else--\nFATHER: No, not anyone else.  Just me.\nGUARD #1: Just you.\nGUARD #2: Hic!\nFATHER: Get back.\nGUARD #1: Get back.\nFATHER: All right?\nGUARD #1: Right.  We'll stay here until you get back.\nGUARD #2: Hic!\nFATHER: And, uh, make sure he doesn't leave.\nGUARD #1: What?\nFATHER: Make sure 'e doesn't leave.\nGUARD #1: The Prince?\nFATHER: Yes.  Make sure 'e doesn't leave.\nGUARD #1: Oh, yes, of course.  \nGUARD #2: Hic!\nGUARD #1: Ah.  I thought you meant him.  You know, it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard.\nFATHER: Is that clear?\nGUARD #2: Hic!\nGUARD #1: Oh, quite clear.  No problems.\nFATHER: Right.  Where are you going?\nGUARD #1: We're coming with you.\nFATHER: No, no.  I want you to stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave.\nGUARD #1: Oh, I see.  Right.\nHERBERT: But Father!\nFATHER: Shut your noise, you!  And get that suit on! [music] And no singing!\nGUARD #2: Hic!\nFATHER: Oh, go and get a glass of water.

'To whoever finds this note: I have been imprisoned by my father, who wishes me to marry against my will.  Please, please, please come and rescue me.  I am in the Tall Tower of Swamp Castle.' At last!  A call!  A cry of distress!  This could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail!  Brave, brave Concorde, you shall not have died in vain!\nCONCORDE: Uh, I'm-- I'm not quite dead, sir.\nLAUNCELOT: Well, you shall not have been mortally wounded in vain!\nCONCORDE: I-- I-- I think I c-- I could pull through, sir.\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, I see.\nCONCORDE: Actually, I think I'm all right to come with you, sir--\nLAUNCELOT: No, no, sweet Concorde!  Stay here!  I will send help as soon as I have accomplished a daring and heroic rescue in my own particular...  [sigh] \nCONCORDE: Idiom, sir?\nLAUNCELOT: Idiom!\nCONCORDE: No, I feel fine, actually, sir.\nLAUNCELOT: Farewell, sweet Concorde!\nCONCORDE: I'll, um, I'll just stay here then.  Shall I, sir?

You see, I hadn't--\nHERBERT: I knew someone would.  I knew that somewhere out there...  [music] \nLAUNCELOT: Well, I--\nHERBERT: ... there must be...  someone...\nFATHER: Stop that!  Stop that!  Stop it!  Stop it!  Who are you?\nHERBERT: I'm your son!\nFATHER: No, not you.\nLAUNCELOT: Uh, I am Sir Launcelot, sir.\nHERBERT: He's come to rescue me, Father.\nLAUNCELOT: Well, let's not jump to conclusions.\nFATHER: Did you kill all those guards?\nLAUNCELOT: Uh...  Oh, yes.  Sorry.\nFATHER: They cost fifty pounds each!\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I'm awfully sorry.  Um, I really can explain everything.\nHERBERT: Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot.  I've got a rope all ready.\nFATHER: You killed eight wedding guests in all!\nLAUNCELOT: Well, uh, you see, the thing is, I thought your son was a lady.\nFATHER: I can understand that.\nHERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!  Hurry!\nFATHER: Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father, that's all!\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I really didn't mean to...\nFATHER: Didn't mean to?!  You put your sword right through his head!\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, dear.  Is he all right?\nFATHER: You even kicked the bride in the chest!  This is going to cost me a fortune!\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I can explain.  I was in the forest, um, riding north from Camelot, when I got this note, you see--\nFATHER: Camelot?  Are you from, uh, Camelot?\nHERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!\nLAUNCELOT: Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir.\nFATHER: Very nice castle, Camelot.  Uh, very good pig country...\nLAUNCELOT: Is it?\nHERBERT: Hurry!  I'm ready!\nFATHER: Would you, uh, like to come and have a drink?\nLAUNCELOT: Well, that-- that's, uh, awfully nice of you, ...\nHERBERT: I am ready!\nLAUNCELOT: ... um, I mean to be so understanding. [thonk] Um, ... [woosh] \nHERBERT: Oooh!\nLAUNCELOT: ... I'm afraid when I'm in this idiom, I sometimes get a bit, uh, sort of carried away.\nFATHER: Oh, don't worry about that.\nHERBERT: Oooh! [splat] \nSCENE 17:\nGUESTS: [crying] \nFATHER: Well, this is the main hall.  We're going to have all this knocked through, and made into one big, uh, living room.\nGUEST: There he is!\nFATHER: Oh, bloody hell.\nLAUNCELOT: Ha ha ha!  Hey!  Ha ha!\nFATHER: Hold it!  Stop it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Please!\nLAUNCELOT: Sorry.  Sorry.  You see what I mean?  I just get carried away.  I'm really most awfully sorry.  Sorry!  Sorry, everyone.\nGUEST #1: He's killed the best man!\nGUESTS: [yelling] \nFATHER: Hold it!  Hold it!  Please!  Hold it!  This is Sir Launcelot from the Court of Camelot, a very brave and influential knight, and my special guest here today.\nLAUNCELOT: Hello.\nGUEST: He killed my auntie!\nGUESTS: [yelling] \nFATHER: Please!  Please!  This is supposed to be a happy occasion!  Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.  We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock.  Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.\nGUESTS: Oh!  Oh no!\nFATHER: But I don't want to think I've not lost a son, so much as...  gained a daughter! [clap clap clap] For, since the tragic death of her father--\nGUEST #2: He's not quite dead!\nFATHER: Since the near fatal wounding of her father--\nGUEST #2: He's getting better!\nFATHER: For, since her own father, who, when he seemed about to recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him.\nBRIDE'S FATHER: Uugh!\nGUEST #2: Oh, he's died!\nFATHER: And I want his only daughter to look upon me as her old dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense. [clap clap clap] And I feel sure that the merger-- er, the union between the Princess and the brave, but dangerous, Sir Launcelot of Camelot--\nLAUNCELOT: What?\nGUEST #2: Look!  The dead Prince!\nGUESTS: Oooh!  The dead Prince!\nCONCORDE: He's not quite dead.\nHERBERT: No, I feel much better.\nFATHER: You fell out of the Tall Tower, you creep!\nHERBERT: No, I was saved at the last minute.\nFATHER: How?!\nHERBERT: Well, I'll tell you. [music] \nFATHER: Not like that!  Not like that!  No!  Stop it!\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell!  He's going to tell! ...\nFATHER: Shut uuup!\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ...\nFATHER: Shut up!\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ...\nFATHER: Shut up!\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ...\nFATHER: Not like that!\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell!

He's going to tell! ...\nLAUNCELOT: No!  It's not right for my idiom!\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell about his great escape...\nLAUNCELOT: I must escape more...  [sigh] \nGUESTS: [singing] Oh, he fell a long, long way...\nCONCORDE: Dramatically, sir?\nLAUNCELOT: Dramatically!\nGUESTS: [singing] But he's here with us today...\nLAUNCELOT: Heee!  Hoa! [crash] Hoo!\nGUESTS: [singing] What a wonderful escape!\nLAUNCELOT: Excuse me.  Could, uh-- could somebody give me a push, please\nSCENE 18: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] [rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!] \nARTHUR: Old crone! [rewr!] [music stops] Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery? [dramatic chord] \nOLD CRONE: Who sent you?\nARTHUR: The Knights Who Say 'Ni'.\nCRONE: Aggh!  No!  Never!  We have no shrubberies here.\nARTHUR: If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will say...  we will say...  'ni'.\nCRONE: Agh!  Do your worst!\nARTHUR: Very well!  If you will not assist us voluntarily, ...  ni!\nCRONE: No!  Never!  No shrubberies!\nARTHUR: Ni!\nCRONE: [cough] \nBEDEVERE: Nu!\nARTHUR: No, no, no, no...\nBEDEVERE: Nu!\nARTHUR: No, it's not that, it's 'ni'.\nBEDEVERE: Nu!\nARTHUR: No, no-- 'ni'.

There is a pestilence upon this land.  Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.\nARTHUR: Did you say 'shrubberies'?\nROGER: Yes.  Shrubberies are my trade.  I am a shrubber.  My name is Roger the Shrubber.  I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.\nBEDEVERE: Ni!\nARTHUR: No!  No, no, no!  No\nSCENE 19:\nARTHUR: O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.  May we go now?\nHEAD KNIGHT: It is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly.  But there is one small problem.\nARTHUR: What is that?\nHEAD KNIGHT: We are now...  no longer the Knights Who Say 'Ni'.\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Ni!  Shh!\nHEAD KNIGHT: Shh!  We are now the Knights Who Say 'Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-pikang-zoop-boing-goodem-zoo-owli-zhiv'.\nRANDOM: Ni!\nHEAD KNIGHT: Therefore, we must give you a test.\nARTHUR: What is this test, O Knights of-- Knights Who 'Til Recently Said 'Ni'?\nHEAD KNIGHT: Firstly, you must find...  another shrubbery! [dramatic chord] \nARTHUR: Not another shrubbery!\nRANDOM: Ni!\nHEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.\nKNIGHTS OF NI: A path!  A path!  A path!  Ni!  Shh!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Shh!  Shh! ...\nHEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest...  with...  a herring! [dramatic chord] \nARTHUR: We shall do no such thing!\nHEAD KNIGHT: Oh, please!\nARTHUR: Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done.\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaugh!  Aaaugh!\nHEAD KNIGHT: Augh!  Ohh!  Don't say that word.\nARTHUR: What word?\nHEAD KNIGHT: I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear.\nARTHUR: How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\nHEAD KNIGHT: You said it again!\nARTHUR: What, 'is'?\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Agh!  No, not 'is'.\nHEAD KNIGHT: No, not 'is'.  You wouldn't get vary far in life not saying 'is'.\nKNIGHTS OF NI: No, not 'is'.  Not 'is'.\nBEDEVERE: My liege, it's Sir Robin!\nMINSTREL: [singing] Packing it in and packing it up, And sneaking away and buggering up, And chickening out and pissing off home, Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge.\nARTHUR: Sir Robin!\nROBIN: My liege!  It's good to see you.\nHEAD KNIGHT: Now he's said the word!  \nARTHUR: Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail?\nMINSTREL: [singing] He is sneaking away and buggering up--\nROBIN: Shut up!  No, no.  No.  Far from it.\nHEAD KNIGHT: He said the word again!\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\nROBIN: I was looking for it.\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\nROBIN: Uh, here-- here in this forest.\nARTHUR: No, it is far from this place.\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\nHEAD KNIGHT: Aaaaugh!  Stop saying the word!  The word...\nARTHUR: Oh, stop it!\nKNIGHTS OF NI: ... we cannot hear!\nHEAD KNIGHT: Ow!  He said it again!\nARTHUR: Patsy!\nHEAD KNIGHT: Wait!  I said it!  I said it! [clop clop clop] Ooh!  I said it again!  And there again!  That's three 'it's!  Ohh!\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh\nNARRATOR: And so, Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene twenty-four.  Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much rejoicing.\nKNIGHTS: Yay!  Yay! [woosh] \nNARRATOR: In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's minstrels.\nMINSTREL: [high-pitched] Get back!  Eee!\nNARRATOR: And there was much rejoicing.\nKNIGHTS: Yay!\nNARRATOR: A year passed.\nCARTOON CHARACTER: [shivering] \nNARRATOR: Winter changed into Spring.\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Mmm, nice.\nNARRATOR: Spring changed into Summer.\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Oh.  Ahh.\nNARRATOR: Summer changed back into Winter.\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Oh?\nNARRATOR: And Winter gave Spring and Summer a miss and went straight on into Autumn.\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Aah. [snap] Oh!

Tim?\nARTHUR: Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.\nTIM: Greetings, King Arthur!\nARTHUR: You know my name?\nTIM: I do. [zoosh] You seek the Holy Grail!\nARTHUR: That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden, O Tim.\nTIM: Quite. [pweeng boom] [clap clap clap] \nROBIN: Oh.\nARTHUR: Yes, we're-- we're looking for the Holy Grail.  Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.\nKNIGHTS: Yeah.  Yes.  It is.  It is.  Yeah.  Yup.  Yup.

[boom pweeng boom boom] \nARTHUR: Look, um, you're a busy man, uh--\nTIM: Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.\nKNIGHTS: Oh, thank you.  Oh...\nTIM: To the north there lies a cave-- the cave of Caerbannog-- wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged... [boom] ... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.\nARTHUR: Where could we find this cave, O Tim?\nTIM: Follow.  But!  Follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived!  Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair.  So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.\nARTHUR: What an eccentric performance\nSCENE 21: [clop clop clop] [whinny whinny] \nGALAHAD: They're nervous, sire.\nARTHUR: Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.  Dis-mount!\nTIM: Behold the cave of Caerbannog!\nARTHUR: Right!  Keep me covered.\nGALAHAD: What with?\nARTHUR: W-- just keep me covered.\nTIM: Too late!

I soiled my armor I was so scared!\nTIM: Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide; it's a killer!\nGALAHAD: Get stuffed!\nTIM: He'll do you up a treat mate!\nGALAHAD: Oh, yeah?\nROBIN: You mangy scots git!\nTIM: I'm warning you!\nROBIN: What's he do, nibble your bum?\nTIM: He's got huge, sharp-- eh-- he can leap about-- look at the bones!\nARTHUR: Go on, Bors.  Chop his head off!\nBORS: Right!  Silly little bleeder.  One rabbit stew comin' right up!\nTIM: Look! [squeak] \nBORS: Aaaugh!

Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?  Well, it's always the same.  I always tell them--\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up!\nTIM: Do they listen to me?\nARTHUR: Right!\nTIM: Oh, no...\nKNIGHTS: Charge!

How many did we lose?\nLAUNCELOT: Gawain.\nGALAHAD: Ector.\nARTHUR: And Bors.  That's five.\nGALAHAD: Three, sir.\nARTHUR: Three.  Three.  And we'd better not risk another frontal assault.  That rabbit's dynamite.\nROBIN: Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up and go and change your armor.\nGALAHAD: Let us taunt it!  It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.\nARTHUR: Like what?\nGALAHAD: Well...  ooh.\nLAUNCELOT: Have we got bows?\nARTHUR: No.\nLAUNCELOT: We have the Holy Hand Grenade.\nARTHUR: Yes, of course!  The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch!  'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him!  Brother Maynard!  Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!\nMONKS: [chanting] Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, donaeis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.

And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu--\nMAYNARD: Skip a bit, Brother.\nSECOND BROTHER: And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin.  Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.  Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.  Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.  Five is right out.  Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.'\nMAYNARD: Amen.\nKNIGHTS: Amen.\nARTHUR: Right!  One...  two...  five!\nGALAHAD: Three, sir!\nARTHUR: Three! [angels sing] [boom] \nSCENE 22:\nARTHUR: There!  Look!\nLAUNCELOT: What does it say?\nGALAHAD: What language is that?\nARTHUR: Brother Maynard!  You are a scholar.\nMAYNARD: It's Aramaic!\nGALAHAD: Of course!  Joseph of Arimathea!\nLAUNCELOT: 'Course!\nARTHUR: What does it say?\nMAYNARD: It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea.  He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of uuggggggh'.\nARTHUR: What?\nMAYNARD: '...  the Castle of uuggggggh'.\nBEDEVERE: What is that?\nMAYNARD: He must have died while carving it.\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, come on!\nMAYNARD: Well, that's what it says.\nARTHUR: Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve 'aaggggh'.  He'd just say it!\nMAYNARD: Well, that's what's carved in the rock!\nGALAHAD: Perhaps he was dictating.\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up.  Well, does it say anything else?\nMAYNARD: No.  Just, 'uuggggggh'.\nLAUNCELOT: Aauuggghhh.\nARTHUR: Aaauggh.\nBEDEVERE: Do you suppose he meant the Camaaaaaargue?\nGALAHAD: Where's that?\nBEDEVERE: France, I think.\nLAUNCELOT: Isn't there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall?\nARTHUR: No, that's Saint Ives.\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, yes.

[thud] \nFRENCH GUARD: Allo, dappy English k-niggets and Monsieur Arthur King, who has the brain of a duck, you know.  So, we French fellows outwit you a second time!\nARTHUR: How dare you profane this place with your presence!  I command you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, to open the doors of this sacred castle, to which God Himself has guided us!\nFRENCH GUARD: How you English say, 'I one more time, mac, unclog my nose in your direction', sons of a window-dresser!  So, you think you could out-clever us French folk with your silly knees-bent running about advancing behaviour?!  I wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of second hand electric donkey-bottom biters.\nARTHUR: In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred castle!\nFRENCH GUARD: No chance, English bed-wetting types.  I burst my pimples at you and call your door-opening request a silly thing, you tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms!\nARTHUR: If you do not open this door, we shall take this castle by force! [splat] In the name of God and the glory of our-- [splat] \nFRENCH GUARDS: [laughing] \nARTHUR: Agh.  Right!  That settles it!\nFRENCH GUARD: Yes, depart a lot at this time, and cut the approaching any more or we fire arrows at the tops of your heads and make castanets out of your testicles already!  Ha ha haaa ha!\nARTHUR: Walk away.  Just ignore them.\nFRENCH GUARD: And now, remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!  And, if you think you got a nasty taunting this time, you ain't heard nothing yet, dappy English k-nnniggets!  Thpppt!\nFRENCH GUARDS: [taunting] \nARTHUR: We shall attack at once!\nBEDEVERE: Yes, my liege!\nARTHUR: Stand by for attack!

In the name of God, ...\nFRENCH GUARDS: Hoo hoo!  Ohh, ha ha ha ha ha! ...\nARTHUR: ... we shall not stop our fight 'til each one of you lies dead, and the Holy Grail returns to those whom God has chosen!\nFRENCH GUARDS: ...

# ### code

# - Split the script holy_grail into lines using the newline ('\n') character.
# - Use re.sub() inside a list comprehension to replace the prompts such as ARTHUR: and SOLDIER #1. The pattern has been written for you.
# - Use a list comprehension to tokenize lines with regexp_tokenize(), keeping only words. Recall that the pattern for words is "\w+".
# - Use a list comprehension to create a list of line lengths called line_num_words.
#   - Use t_line as your iterator variable to iterate over tokenized_lines, and then len() function to compute line lengths.
# - Plot a histogram of line_num_words using plt.hist(). Don't forgot to use plt.show() as well to display the plot.
