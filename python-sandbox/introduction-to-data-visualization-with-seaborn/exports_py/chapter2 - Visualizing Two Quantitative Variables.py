# > ## Creating subplots with col and row
# > 
# > We've seen in prior exercises that students with more absences (`"absences"`) tend to have lower final grades (`"G3"`). Does this relationship hold regardless of how much time students study each week?
# > 
# > To answer this, we'll look at the relationship between the number of absences that a student has in school and their final grade in the course, creating separate subplots based on each student's weekly study time (`"study_time"`).

# 
# > ## Creating two-factor subplots
# > 
# > Let's continue looking at the `student_data` dataset of students in secondary school. Here, we want to answer the following question: does a student's first semester grade (`"G1"`) tend to correlate with their final grade (`"G3"`)?
# > 
# > There are many aspects of a student's life that could result in a higher or lower final grade in the class. For example, some students receive extra educational support from their school (`"schoolsup"`) or from their family (`"famsup"`), which could result in higher grades. Let's try to control for these two factors by creating subplots based on whether the student received extra educational support from their school or family.
# > 
# > Seaborn has been imported as `sns` and `matplotlib.pyplot` has been imported as `plt`.

# > Use `relplot()` to create a scatter plot with `"G1"` on the x-axis and `"G3"` on the y-axis, using the `student_data` DataFrame.

# In[7]:


# Create a scatter plot of G1 vs. G3
sns.relplot(x='G1', y='G3', data=student_data, kind='scatter')



# Show plot
plt.show()


# > Create **column** subplots based on whether the student received support from the school (`"schoolsup"`), ordered so that "yes" comes before "no".

# In[9]:


# Adjust to add subplots based on school support

            data=student_data,
            kind="scatter", col='schoolsup', col_order=['yes', 'no'])

# Show plot
plt.show()


# > Add **row** subplots based on whether the student received support from the family (`"famsup"`), ordered so that "yes" comes before "no". This will result in subplots based on two factors.
