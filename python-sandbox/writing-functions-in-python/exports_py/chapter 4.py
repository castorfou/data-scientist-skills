# ## Print the return type
# You are debugging a package that you've been working on with your friends. Something weird is happening with the data being returned from one of your functions, but you're not even sure which function is causing the trouble. You know that sometimes bugs can sneak into your code when you are expecting a function to return one thing, and it returns something different. For instance, if you expect a function to return a numpy array, but it returns a list, you can get unexpected behavior. To ensure this is not what is causing the trouble, you decide to write a decorator, print_return_type(), that will print out the type of the variable that gets returned from every call of any function it is decorating.

# ### code

# In[1]:


def print_return_type(func):
  # Define wrapper(), the decorated function
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    # Call the function being decorated
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    print('{}() returned type {}'.format(
      func.__name__, type(result)
    ))
    return result
  # Return the decorated function
  return wrapper
  
@print_return_type
def foo(value):
  return value
  
print(foo(42))
print(foo([1, 2, 3]))
print(foo({'a': 42}))


# ## Counter
# You're working on a new web app, and you are curious about how many times each of the functions in it gets called. So you decide to write a decorator that adds a counter to each function that you decorate. You could use this information in the future to determine whether there are sections of code that you could remove because they are no longer being used by the app.

# ### code

# In[2]:


def counter(func):
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    wrapper.count += 1
    # Call the function being decorated and return the result
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
  wrapper.count = 0
  # Return the new decorated function
  return wrapper

# Decorate foo() with the counter() decorator
@counter
def foo():
  print('calling foo()')
  
foo()

print('foo() was called {} times.'.format(foo.count))


# # Decorators and metadata

# ## Preserving docstrings when decorating functions
# Your friend has come to you with a problem. They've written some nifty decorators and added them to the functions in the open-source library they've been working on. However, they were running some tests and discovered that all of the docstrings have mysteriously disappeared from their decorated functions. Show your friend how to preserve docstrings and other metadata when writing decorators.

# ## Measuring decorator overhead
# Your boss wrote a decorator called check_everything() that they think is amazing, and they are insisting you use it on your function. However, you've noticed that when you use it to decorate your functions, it makes them run much slower. You need to convince your boss that the decorator is adding too much processing time to your function. To do this, you are going to measure how long the decorated function takes to run and compare it to how long the undecorated function would have taken to run. This is the decorator in question:
# ```
# def check_everything(func):
#   @wraps(func)
#   def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
#     check_inputs(*args, **kwargs)
#     result = func(*args, **kwargs)
#     check_outputs(result)
#     return result
#   return wrapper

# ## HTML Generator

# ## Tag your functions
# Tagging something means that you have given that thing one or more strings that act as labels. For instance, we often tag emails or photos so that we can search for them later. You've decided to write a decorator that will let you tag your functions with an arbitrary list of tags. You could use these tags for many things:
# 
# - Adding information about who has worked on the function, so a user can look up who to ask if they run into trouble using it.
# - Labeling functions as "experimental" so that users know that the inputs and outputs might change in the future.
# - Marking any functions that you plan to remove in a future version of the code.
# - Etc.

# In[23]:

      # Call the function being decorated and return the result

# ## Check the return type
# Python's flexibility around data types is usually cited as one of the benefits of the language. It can occasionally cause problems though if incorrect data types go unnoticed. You've decided that in order to make sure your code is doing exactly what you want it to do, you will explicitly check the return types of all of your functions and make sure they are what you expect them to be. To do that, you are going to create a decorator that checks that the return type of the decorated function is correct.
# 
# Note: assert(condition) is a function that you can use to test whether something is true. If condition is True, this function doesn't do anything. If condition is False, this function raises an error. The type of error that it raises is called an AssertionError.
