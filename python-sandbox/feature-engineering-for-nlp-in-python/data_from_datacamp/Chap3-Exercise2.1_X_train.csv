446,the more i analyze this film the worse it becomes first of all why a motivational speaker that part was just stupid i mean why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker is alexander stone really that disorganized first he can t decide what he wants to do to control the world so he looks to the bible for ideas many of these ideas i might add really have no reliability for example the part of the the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror could have already happened it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something and gillen lane s family they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water i might add that since casper van dien gillen lane is only in his twenties or that s the impression that i had and has a ten year child he had his child during high school yeah there goes tbn s family values also why did this film have to be so damn propaganda like i ll repeat what an earlier reviewer said the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated this film doesn t do that the beginnig starts off well with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy s omega code then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of the two prophets tell him tell your master that we are here dominic ironsides replies he already knows and points to a small surveillance camera that part sent chills up my spine had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film i ll give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character as does michael ironsides but the good guys are horrible i ve already went on about lane s family now that i m over the acting i ll get on to plot this is obviously a baptist film since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well done also another diatribe against the vatican their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded since gillen explains to the pope that it s not the end of the world but the beginning of a new one also the vatican or israelis says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world whoever it was they wouldn t just secede they d send over commandoes and kill them this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying we re not going to talk to you any more come on i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor mediocre in short 
937,when i borrowed this movie from a friend thankfully i did not buy it on the package which truly looked bad and ugly was printed the ultimate vampire horror after watching it i thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself the story begins when a teenager surprise is chased by some vampire zombie creatures lighting sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday video on a ten year old vhs system if not worse i gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the promo t shirts looked kind of cool i don t want to dis film students or splatter movies generally but i ve seen braindead and i ve seen a 20 dollar budget movie from students that was ten times better than this crap 
316,recap a lone swordsman living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen recollects how his life turned out to be as it is it started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead causing him to leave his home town one of the swordsmen is huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister but the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have huang protected and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person comments i ve seen the redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994 how the two versions differ i can t say but the redux is very heavily stylized in the way of chinese wuxia action that is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie a comprehensible story but true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director kar wai wong therefore there are lots of colorful very beautiful scenes that are completely unrelated to the story the editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled much is left out in the scenes the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated the result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie thanks to these brutal but very few fights the movie is put into the action genre the poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action the other couldn t be farther away from it the movie in its entirety is very slow dull and hence very boring not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie i might say that i m not a fan of this chinese style since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems most importantly that the visual is more important than the story but ashes of time redux is perhaps the worst example i ve seen 3 10
990,christophe lambert once said he was still making movies only to make good and easy money when i see his latest releases i can believe that beowulf is all in all in the good part of the crap movies there are some good thrill scenes indeed the actors themselves aren t too bad but the plot is silly the mortal kombat like music has nothing to do here the ending is really s y really the only good thing about it is that me and my friends could laugh about how uninteresting it was i even wish i wasted my money on something else 
793,a couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy non seen flicks my friend grabbed head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie well you guessed it it was me i have never been so embarrised in all my life we got home and put it on and we rolled about the floor laughing for about 45mins because this was the funniest film in the world i cant remember much about it but one thing i do remember was the blonde girl getting it on with some guy in the back of a shop every 5 mins that head made me laugh and when i look at other peoples comments aboout this movie it makes me laugh even more head of the family is so good and the head is funny and im still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
649,budget decent actors who knew these things were important don t waste your time on this piece of junk the effects are crap the acting is crap the only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little cheap t a and that gets squandered in the first 20 minutes the only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity it was like they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never cursed before hats off if you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old prom photos the only way for a bigfoot flick to be any good is for it to have a big budget and some actors who didn t come from frogballs community theater 
182,with harry callahan getting up in years the inevitable old man with a chip on his shoulder story had to come into play eventually callahan looking fragile sometimes and out of place his demeanor still was unwavering thankfully this film took some time off to develop a different type of story one that might reinvent the dirty harry and the whole genre while the film fell short in doing so it was still an excellent addition to the series even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and new wave music 
50,human pot roast joe don baker mitchell stars in this dull unremarkable action movie as deputy geronimo a fat gassy slob who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit listening to country music and eating too many donuts meanwhile a vaguely criminal guy named palermo played by the guy who owned the drill in fulci s gates of hell stumbles into joe don s territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene joe don slowly gives chase and offs palermo s brother after uttering his now legendary catch phrase it s your move think you can take me well go ahead on for some reason joe don a texas lawman must transport palermo to italy mr palermo s been a major source of embarrassment to the italian government says mr wilson another vague character played by bill mckinney who was in master ninja 1 she freak and a lot of good clint eastwood movies anyhoo joe don s plane must land on the island of malta where palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like jon lovitz and that s where the movie grinds to a halt for the rest of the movie joe don looks for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more then joe don keeps looking for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more then joe don looks for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more this is one aggravating movie at one point joe don is thought to be dead at sea all the other characters wonder if he s dead or not finally concluding that he is but then he shows up he was rescued by a poor family and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days even his cute julia louise dreyfuss esque sidekick doesn t welcome him back she does however offer to help him find palermo so joe don looks for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more highpoints include a bizarre carnival with strange colorful floats some sexy strippers a shoot out involving a kid dressed like napoleon and a cart of tomatoes a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk and any scene without joe don lowpoints include joe don threatening a stripper with a coat hanger it should be noted that this is from greydon clark director of angel s revenge who appears as the sheriff ick 
858,superhero movie 2008 is the most recent in the long line over parody movie movies which i despise so much i wish this movie could be the death of the genre but i know that it isn t awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin if meet the spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go than superhero movie is probably near the top unfortunately meet the spartans was actually miles below the barrel and this movie just barely makes it in superhero movie has a decent cast of c list celebs it s got drake bell the kid from disney s drake and josh leslie nielson airplane tracy morgan snl and 30 rock and a few others scattered throughout although it has the star power to light a 40 watt bulb the movie fails to utilize any humor this movie is about 80 minutes long most of which is dedicated to following the spiderman plot and not one single joke is funny i didn t laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire time don t see this movie don t even think about it for the love of cinema just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another one oh who am i kidding they ll probably come out with another one by fall 
536,i first saw rob roy twelve years ago with little money for entertainment i rented it for my fiancé and i to watch on a bone chilling winter s night the movie i had wanted was gone so i rented this instead not expecting much and was very much surprised with how good it was i just recently watched it again and loved it every bit as much as the first time for those unfamiliar with the story it s about scottish outlaw robert roy macgregor a cattleman and folk hero from the little i know about the man and his story liberties have been taken with the facts but it s a movie not a textbook and so the filmmakers can be excused basically the plot of the movie is that rob roy borrows money from the marquis of montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from but his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the marquis and mary his wife suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of archibald cunningham a smarmy englishman with no soul atrocities ensue until in an immensely satisfying conclusion rob carves archibald up like a christmas turkey there are many great performances in this movie but allow me to touch specifically on a few liam neeson as usual is fantastic a sexy beast you can t take your eyes off of honestly this man is like ice cream even when he s bad he s good his rob roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him in the best way he knows how jessica lange as mary gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure you just know she doesn t take any b s from rob or anyone else for that matter tim roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil archibald yet somehow it works all the posturing and preening combined with some wicked dialogue result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory combine all of this and the stellar work by other supporting players with the luscious scenery of scotland and you have what amounts to one really really cool movie if you haven t seen this i highly recommend that you do 
783,i like breillat s movies but this one is the best i ve seen at balancing animal warmth with sexual intelligence anne parillaud is electric and the script is amazing especially considering it s supposed to take place on the set of another of breillat s movies you don t have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this it made me think a lot about vulnerability and power try to imagine a male director with jeanne s openness not impossible but a little mind bending the unannounced sexual undercurrents that are always present when humans get together to make anything is held up to bright light here but not a cold light 
255,this movie appears to have designed as a fred astaire ginger rogers film the plot outline dance numbers zippy music and the entire formula is there except for ginger whether it really was originally intended as a re pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films instead of the usual sidekicks for fred such as eric blore or edward everett horton burns and allen are used probably since despite being known as a comedy team they could sing and dance quite well this actually shocked me but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional fred and ginger numbers were done with either fred and gracie or these two along with george only once at the very end does ms fontaine dance with fred but it s very brief and with a distant camera shot and speaking of burns and allen i think i owe it to the team to talk about them in the film i have never been a fan of their show or their movies in general i find gracie s idiot act very annoying and i have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full length films however in this film i must admit that they were great not only dancing competently but i actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by edward everett horton very nicely they were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department now as for the rest of the film it s all a lot of fun and is entertaining the problem for me though was that joan fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie not just because she was acting outside her range after all she wasn t a singer or dancer but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint because of this the usual balance and great boy girl dialog was lacking there was also a very charming performance by harry watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupid all because he wanted to win a bet and finally i loved the fun house and tunnel of love sequence it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch overall i did like the film quite a bit it had a lot of charm and excellent writing unfortunately it also featured a bland performance by ms fontaine that knocks off a point bringing my score for this film to 7 
950,for this movie based off of a tv show and a serious finale i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious m a s h goodbye farewell and amen was pretty good but not this one unless you really love the series like myself skip this movie i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens but the plot was too gimmicky and dave coulier man that guy hasn t done anything good well ever they shouldn t have used tim meadows he s a great actor but he was too good for the script i thought the movie was pure cheese i would give it a 4 5 10
800,i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan a culture i know very little about i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint i watched this with someone who didn t read the book and he also enjoyed it they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over you feel for the characters and their plights i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime 
309,as much as i like big epic pictures i ll spare you the namedropping it s great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes films where the plot takes a backseat to the set pieces films where the dialogue isn t so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose there are hundreds of films that fit the bill but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better ones it s an update of the movie that shares its name it also shares that picture s ethos but not quite it s execution whatever was great about the original has been streamlined whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster see the pug ugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it but here thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors sixty succeeds the plot and much of the dialogue isn t much to write imdb about often you ll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors each of whom will voice it with different inflections a lot of people found this annoying i find it raises a smile each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here with cage jolie and duvall leading the pack of course and it should be noted that it s also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here the chemistry between good ol saint nick the stalwart see date of review and angelina leads to a couple of nice moments the villain is not even a little scary i ve seen chris eccleston play tough guy roles before so i know he can handle them but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action we know the heroes are going to succeed somehow we re just sitting in the car with them enjoying the ride i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating in fact i wouldn t have minded some fourth wall breaking winks at the camera it s just that kind of movie all this style and not so much substance something that often exhausts my patience if not executed just so would be worthless if the action wasn t there and for the most part it is wonderfully so i ve noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast cut extreme close up shots to direct action these days i personally find this kind of thing exhausting i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time i ve been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance in real life i mean his character clearly doesn t care and it shows the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow burning climatic finale where he drives a mustang into the ground in the most outlandish and fun way possible so yes this movie isn t an epic life affirming post 9 11 picture with obligatory social commentary effort the pacing is uneven some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line but car movies rarely come better than this so if you hate cars why are you even reading these comments i d take it over the numerous iterations of the flaccid and the tedious guess the franchise any day 7 10
701,this has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films i have ever seen merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence sex and a minimalist retelling of the life of jesus christ the high contrast and thick layer of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times but the use of texture combined with the extreme contrast create an incredible viewing experience this film is not for everyone i think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content which if extremely rough but does make a fairly important statement about creation god and humanity whether this film is a work of art or shock value trash is open to discussion 
606,whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the 19th century libby and george were married for 12 years until the little big horn what s not known to today s audience is that libby survived until 1933 during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing but if done from libby s point of view they could be understood and forgiven sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer he was retired and replaced by george b mcclellan in late 1861 while custer was still at west point i m not sure they ever met but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema errol flynn and olivia dehavilland this was the last of eight films they did together the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libby s farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign both their performances olivia s especially was a high point in their careers at warner brothers we know through history that custer is riding to his doom that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy if your eyes don t moisten you are made of marble as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action you can t beat this film at all 
779,the saddest thing about this tribute is that almost all the singers including the otherwise incredibly talented nick cave seem to have missed the whole point where cohen s intensity lies by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry his irony his all round humanity laughter and tears in one to see some of these singer upstarts make convoluted suffering faces launch their pathetic squeals in the patent effort to scream i m a singer is a true pain it s the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as lennon s imagine nothing simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original if there is a form of art that doesn t need embellishments it s cohen s art embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless make up of sex for sale in this cohen s tribute i found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and if truth be told several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show it s cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material really not the other way around they may have been friends or his daughter s he could have become very tender hearted and in the mood for a gift too bad it didn t stay in the family fortunately but only at the very end cohen himself performed his majestic tower of song but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the u2 all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing home a sad show really and sadder if you truly love cohen as i do 
463,pure schlock from beginning to end the average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination otherwise it s a pure camp fest endurance test like one of those so so episodes of star trek the next generation that thinks it has something important to say you ll see every plot twist a mile off in this by the numbers romp however it s worth seeing for its portrayal of drag king prostitutes a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them how s that for role reversal and lesbian soap operas the ghost of valerie solanis lives 
46,there s only one thing i m going to say about cat in the hat as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren t exactly kid appropriate oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying as for the plot i completely forgot who cares it sucked anyway i m not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded but so what it was annoying don t see it it belongs in the bottom 100 the jokes are so unkiddy it s funny
314,oh man is this movie bad it flows horribly the story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this doesn t love himself he tries getting out of the contract and horrible painfully unfunny gags ensue jim nabors seems as if he s sleepwalking not acting you ll miss such burt sidekicks as dom deluise and jerry reed while watching this stinker loni anderson s hair is downright scary proving that tons of hairspray didn t go out in the sixties or maybe that was a wig speaking of burt s wig wasn t bad in this film his worst wig day was in smokey and the bandit 2 anyhow this movie is the worst reynolds car movie ever ever right up there with cannonball run 2 the original smokey and cannonball and hooper which thankfully had no sequel are great funny films this one isn t even ned beatty who is a great actor stinks you ll long for a jackie gleason type villain who is fun to hate and mind you this isn t one of those fun movies to bag on it s lousy pure and simple even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring and worst of all unfunny and least i forget stroker ace was one of the first heavy nails to seal burt s coffin before his somewhat revival years later in boogie nights another film that like deliverance years earlier shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so 
440,this is my favorite renoir from the fifties it s the story of how henri danglard built and launched the moulin rouge nightclub we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway and the training of the dancers finally the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described gabin is in great form as the easy going danglard see him deal humorously with nini s violent boyfriend gianni esposito is moving as the wistful prince who is courting nini maria felix with that amazon s body is imposing as the egotistical lola danglard s first lover finally françoise arnoul as nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for danglard and becoming his girl is just stunning her loveliness and pert charm will win you over a bonus we get edith piaf patachou andré claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the moulin rouge 
877,i ve always knew anne desalvo was a great character actor now i know she is a great writer director also i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect my favorite year dc cab and stardust memories it s so rare to see lee grant these days in anything she has been missing from the screen for far too long it s also wonderful to see cloris leachman in something other than a sit com this is her best work since the last picture show if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie i wasn t expecting a lot when i started watching this movie so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie if you get the chance watch it 
799,i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead i only saw one other play in the 1970 s 1990 s that had an emotional impact like this play did i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn t reprise her role in the film she wasn t well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy spacek instead sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way i love anne bancroft but she seemed too young for this role the movie plot was true to the play anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind 
696,one of the better made for tv biopics i just wish it had told us more i have read many biographies and seen other things about the carpenters and this movie did what it could based on the constraints placed on it by the family cynthis gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring karen to life one of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into karen s anorexia in the reading i have done about the disease especially cherry boone o neill s wonderful book starving for attention anorexia appears to be a disease of control karen saw her weight as one thing in her life that she could control she felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life don t get me wrong i believed she truly loved the music but she felt she had little control over her career she truly loved her family but they did not express it well and she didn t know how to make her family understand her the film could have touched so much more on that i treasure the music i have of the carpenters and wish she was still alive to contribute more to music today 
413,don t get me wrong goldeneye was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise but the series had fallen into a fps rut enter everything or nothing which puts bond in third person when i wrote my earlier review for from russia with love i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise eon definitely is superior in terms of in depth controls and gameplay variety missions range from standard running and gunning to driving an suv driving an aston martin driving a limousine that is wired to explode commandeering two different types of tanks a la goldeneye riding a motorcycle flying a helicopter repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires and free falling after a plummeting damsel sure vehicle controls are a little clumsy but the issue here is the variety as movie adaptations goldeneye and frwl were all that i could have hoped for but eon s original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe shannon elizabeth heidi klum and misaki ito judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q respectively and pierce brosnan while no sean connery adds credibility to the game s proceedings all characters resemble the stars with the disappointing exception of heidi klum who s in game model doesn t do the real life model justice mya s theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies willem defoe s character is a former colleague of christopher walken s baddie from a view to a kill richard kiel appears as jaws the hulking henchman from the spy who loved me and moonraker in three fight scenes the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have single player gameplay mainly consists of standard on foot missions as bond like bond you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth with plenty of wall and object cover unfortunately unlike frwl only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging so bond may end up crouching low when he s supposed to be peeking around a corner and vice versa the game also allows players to go into bond reflex mode while you browse your inventory everything around you will go into super slo mo allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with while this takes some getting used to eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular bond moments such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath and greatly add to the bond movie feeling there are 3 available difficulty levels operative agent and double oh on operative you can breeze through in a few hours on agent a few weeks on double oh a few months the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints but when all is said and done no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie multi player unfortunately is not as thrilling goldeneye still has the best multi player mode of any bond game eon s main multi player is a co op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond s a more standard third person death match can be unlocked from this mode but the single player mode is the most complete bond experience to date the ending as with most bond games is anticlimactic while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing also levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error still for any serious bond fan not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films 
177,you like to solve mysteries you like complex narrations this is for you brilliant clever movie by francis leclerc son of a legendary french canadian signer felix leclerc flashy photo and clever editing is the word of leclerc strongly helped by roy dupuis who s dythirambic in the lead role the plot is about alexandre tourneur veterinary in his 40 s who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer s sufferings on the road throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him not spooky but very mysterious and well played movie i have my hypothesis on the ending i think the indian caused the accident but this ending was open to any explanations i strongly recommend it 9 5 10
34,on the scale of 1 to 10 i gave this a 4 i thought the film was not very good with too much violence and not one character to like on an erotic scale i give this a 6 many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness i always enjoy nudity and nancy travis and faye grant come through but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic 
984,bad news for anyone wanting to film a full length parody of a lifetime network movie the makers of a deadly encounter have already done it albeit unintentionally all of the lifetime tropes are there a divorced mother in peril from a deranged stalker an unreliable ex husband who of course cheated on her while they were married and a police department that patronizingly dismisses her complaints forcing her to stand up for herself especially jaw dropping is the scene where the heroine after enduring a break in and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker decides to relieve the stress by going shopping having seen first hand the harassment of a co worker by some creep she met at church i know stalking is not a joke but it certainly is in this movie 
436,on broadway a chorus line was pure magic from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show we were totally engaged captivated by the intensely personal stories some funny some clever some stirring of this chorus line the movie is another matter entirely the focus is now on the director and what an ogre he is every time the film switches to michael douglas there he is with a bitter sour expression barking out questions and orders screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance yikes that changes the dynamics of the story on broadway the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong fragile intriguing hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity there is a reason this work won the pulitzer prize and actually in one of the only moments the director appears he is there to comfort the young puerto rican dancer after we hear that dancer s heart breaking story he appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection concern for cassie but in the movie from the second douglas director starts bitterly barking orders the chorus line members stories become secondary it s like they are in a lousy profession where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show is jaded exhausted furious at having to audition these chorus members on stage there was always the excitement of the show here in the movie practically from the word go you feel sorry for everyone involved during the course of the musical we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job but of course that couldn t happen but in the finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage sometimes reflecting us in the audience in our hearts and we know also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much bringing magic to the theatre in the movie after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis that magic becomes totally diluted all we feel even with the exact same curtain call is that some of the members got a job with a mean spirited director so they all come on the screen and are dancing again big deal 
917, the running jumping standing still film is not a film as such but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme this film got richard lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first beatles film a hard day s night richard lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959 this film was entitled the running jumping standing still film it was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production since the film was intended to be viewed by lester and his partners alone a small amount of money and time was invested the sole purpose of this film is entertainment but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera the film cost 70 to make and it was filmed in sepia toned film stock in a field on a couple of sundays all of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production the finished production is eleven minutes in length the running jumping standing still film is a comedy about english sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time all of the events in this film take place in a field a few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record a photographer developing film in a pond an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model s face a man building a tent an athlete running over the tent and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away but it also pokes fun at english culture when compared to american culture another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite which has been constructed out of the flag of the united kingdom one of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it and the kite breaks according to neil sinyard author of the films of richard lester this event symbolizes the united kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the united states during the space age according to this scene the british fly primitive kites while the americans the world power after world war ii fly highly advanced rockets and space shuttles 
247,this series is vastly underrated like many others i came upon farscape after the series had been cancelled bought season 1 and was surprised to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense romance wit and of course sci fi right off the bat it got a 10 for being the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero and every alien with whom he comes in contact speaks english okay a few others have skirted the issue but farscape did it the best the point is the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible with so much bad programming out there it s a shame that balanced entertaining series such as farscape don t get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production while we enjoy the four seasons and thankfully the four hour miniseries maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show 
206,what i loved about the on screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel great film as an avid reader i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film ellen burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar however i think the canadian actress christine horne chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise i haven t seen any of horne s previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer 2008 i can t wait to see it on the big screen again 
650,featuring some amazing and wonderful characters a new mythology superbly designed and executed sets nightbreed is a great film sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being unwittingly censored by the white audience the film decries none the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie superhero genre a sequel featuring highlander style flashbacks to different epochs in history would be interesting another idea would be the foundation of the new midian perhaps in texas somewhere or the swamps of lousiana with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus 
556,you can take the crook out of the joint but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook we ve seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before and since in movies like bob le flambeur elevator to the gallows touchez pas au grisbi the anderson tapes etc too many times to mention what helps make this one one of the more notable is of course the heist itself which plays out wordlessly in real time and the demeanor of the lead bogart would think twice before crossing this guy the ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story it almost demands it all around one of the better films noir 
396,this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died idaho colorado territories and montana it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious bad man good man the script is horrible there is very little direction and lousy acting dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade in real life jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city montana to insure that he could never terrorize them again vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately this is a horrible movie i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will even to this day 
265,other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just wanted to add to the whew comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cook s obviously coke fuelled drumming episode this was a doozy i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance a bit of trivia that i am surmising about cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming most energetically is it too much to suggest that cook s spazzy drumming in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by krupa s work as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier if you watch krupa in ball of fire i think you ll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time 
728,i wrote an essay in 1981 the year i graduated high school called the last american virgin i also had a friend named nancy who was the prostitute in this film apparently her daughter got a hold of my essay one night when she slept over my house a year later i wake up one morning and see the advertisement for this film i was 18 years old based the essay on experiences in my life the film is a bit different from my essay but definitely taken from it i did not have any proof of this matter except my english teacher mr versace who gave me an a on my essay i let it go never did anything about it i figured what comes around goes around i still would not take any action against anyone involved in this film i just needed to get it off my chest as i really never told anyone about it except my closest friend they agreed to keep it a secret the same year it came out i saw nancy in a market she actually had the nerve to ask me if i had any good stories or scripts for her to look at i guess thats what hollywood is all about getting stories from wherever you can it was interesting seeing parts of my life on the big screen though ghost writer 
507,look if i were interested in a nancy drew book what i would do is pick up a book and read it i m not ever since i can remember i read people trashing movies because it wasn t like the book i m sorry in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books however i m sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form when lord of the rings came out people complained when the third one won an oscar the book was better when i watched to kill a mockingbird the book was better now a bunch of people are upset yet again because nancy drew wasn t like the book i m not saying nancy drew is going to win any oscars if anything it ll be one of those nickelodeon blimps or kids choice awards i m saying give film a break it s film not paper as a movie i found nancy drew quite enjoyable featuring cameos from bruce willis and adam goldberg the hebrew hammer and supporting roles featuring tate donovan jimmy cooper on the o c and rachel leigh cook she s all that this is the first time i ve seen emma roberts in a movie and frankly i enjoy her work more than most of julia and of eric s her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict a lighthearted movie in the spirit of harriet the spy is nice now and again i give it ten stars because i thoroughly enjoyed the movie would love to see it again and will probably buy it upon dvd release 
654,another raquel welch classic this picture hit the theaters november 10 1969 starring raquel welch as michele james stacey as joe and luke askew as alan morris nikki is on her way to meet with her girl friends michele and jackie while on her way there she runs into her ex husband who wants a second chance nikki walk away from him goes to the table where she sees michele and jackie alan approaches her again and she starts to walk away when alan shoots her in the back nikki is taken to the hospital while michele and jackie go to the police station michele goes to the hospital where she meets up with jackie only to find that nikki died alan then goes after jackie who he hits with a car and then tries to run michele down michele jumps into her car and heads for los angeles when she gets there she calls lloyd her boss in las vegas to let him know that she was all right lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see jeri about a job however there s one problem the bartender has a drug problem and alan knows it so alan and the bartender have a little talk back in los angeles michele not only gets a job as a dancer with jeri but also hooks up with jeri bouncer joe now some thoughts on this picture this picture was far better then raquel last and this one had nonstop action luke askew did a fine job of playing nikki ex husband he was your typical murder with the look that goes with it as for raquel welch performance the only word that comes to mine is fantastic she was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and shined like never before the outfit that she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking in fact all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking of course it doesn t matter what raquel had on because she looks good in everything or nothing i give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons the first and by far is raquel welch who s the leading actress and deserves 10 stars the second reason is that this movie was wall to wall excitement from beginning to end 
377,i usually like these dumb no brain activity movies but this was just too stupid there were way too many clichés and the plot didn t really make much sense there were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt we didn t even get too see if the big master plan worked we only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther the professor that died because of stupidity see below one scene annoyed me particularly why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam and if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes worth of oxygen why didn t he bring two or three of them then he would have survived that was bloody stupid the movie is pretty full of such stupid things i can not recommend it at all 
618,anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal the author of the novel and screenplay to air her prejudices grievances and general antipathy towards the english the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight violent foul mouthed promiscuous engaging in child neglect stupid uneducated racist ugly eating poor food and dim witted tellingly only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be redeemed at the end of the film by contrast the indian family are beautiful clever educated can speak many languages are caring and loving parents and grammar school fodder the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all had it been the other way round an english family in an indian community depicted this way the film would have been seen as racist there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead i thought it would lodge in my hairline first the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration undertext the english are dirty and promiscuous and the men undertext english women are prostitutes second the meal with anita where neema s family lie to her about cutlery undertext the english are so stupid you can make them do anything but the underlying contempt towards anything english even english weddings are an object of scorn is evident all the way through the film the character of anita was drawn so appallingly almost the fallen woman trope that i finished the film feeling angry this is not a bend it like beckham where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community s behaviour and customs from somebody within that community and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together instead anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste and this is underscored by a thinly veiled series of attacks upon the film s other community the english i felt anita and me is a hate filled grievance based piece of work on that basis the bbc should not have funded its production 
69,i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie but i had no idea what i was getting myself into i started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture i finally know what hell is like it s this movie for eternity this movie has no value it didn t even really have a plot there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens instead of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie don t even watch it not even to see how bad it is i beg you if you watch it then it means they win 
768,i really liked zb1 really i did i have no problem with extremely low budget movies and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than zb3 if you can imagine such a thing check out wiseguys vs zombies if you re interested indeed i prefer lower budget zombie films because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are about but zb3 was just so bad it was retarded i don t want to bother being dignified in my criticism i want my 90 minutes back etc except that it really only took 80 minutes because partway through i put it into 1 4x fast forward okay here s some criticism 1 the pacing was terrible everyone talked in monologues even when someone just had a single line the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of f bombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue at first i was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to zb1 s 70 minutes but there were actually fewer events in zb3 it s all talking 2 the gore effects got stupider just glop rubbed around on people s tummies 3 despite the epic exposition there really wasn t a plot and the exposition is indeed epic i won t spoil it if you re going to watch it don t watch it but then it s just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for 80 minutes or fewer if you so choose 
55,my first opinions on this movie were of course bad i was expecting a horrible crappy acting bad entertainment ridiculous special effects movie what i got was actually not that bad the special effects were absolutely horrible but i found the movie itself quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decent the acting wasn t that bad and overall i had fun watching this movie it s still a pretty bad film but it s not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be and i m pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me even when it wasn t that good overall it s a film that should be avoided but to me it wasn t as bad as i was expecting it to be 
875,my mother told me not to go to see kadosh but who ever listens to one s mother i was so turned off by it while i was watching i thought i must have lost my feminist credentials on the way into the theater so i checked with card carrying feminists the next day no they also thought it was much more an anti orthodox screed than a pro feminist statement painting the orthodox as equal to the taliban while this israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the story is about is the ultimate ultra orthodox messianists it is so nasty as to be unbelievable plus that the non fanatic orthodox rock n roller one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexy even in israel that must be fantasy the theater was quite crowded so there s a pent up curiosity to see israeli movies too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution this was almost enough to drive me back to insipid hollywood romantic movies originally written 4 29 2000 
644,this movie is best enjoyed amidst a large audience with the giggle fits very frequently the characters in kadosh are seen staring ahead intensely at nothing very intense unhappy faces very pensive very serious during these moments there is very serious sounding music just to make doublely sure the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games the more entertaining portions of this film come in between the many pensive stares we learn that the women of the kadosh community have two duties one is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands the second is to stay employed so to free their husbands from having to work what do these men do with their ample free time they pray and we learn that at home they pray out loud i give you thanks for not creating me as a woman and at their place of worship they pray to give thanks for possessing functioning male genitalia along with the praying there are many scenes of frenzied antics screaming and endless head bobbing and bodies rocking back and fourth and mixed in with everything are many intricate and bizarre or simple but just as odd ritualistic activities the cream of the unintentional comedy comes from the sex the imagery of an hot and bothered man actively exchanging body fluids with his wife in bed while attempting to keep his beanie from falling off his scalp is unforgettable every sex scene is funny but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against his beautiful wife s yaël abecassis feet oh yes we are finally entering the land of sensuality but no the feet rubbing stops before anything happens and the husband begins his autistic looking head bobbing and body rocking until the scene ends there are three attractive females in near states of undress however kadosh contains absolutely no nudity technically there is some interesting imagery and pleasing uses of light and colors by the director for a more believable educational and entertaining treatment of the plight of being an unclean female unworthy of holding a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed by which a man can cite a phrase from ancient writings i suggest barbra streisand s yentl 
861, queen of the damned is one of the best vampire movies i had ever seen the movie had suspense action and gore the combination of the fierce demanding attitude of the queen and the rock mood of our star very well acted by stuart townsend makes a wonderfully done movie that only this combination can create i m always the one to give advice to my friends and family members on which movies are worthy of renting and when they ask me if queen of the damned is worthy i tell them it s worthy of buying this movie is most for sure a must have in all horror movie lovers homes 
157,considering the film s reputation as truly the worst of the worst i was looking forward to watching wood s crappus opus my word it s not necessarily any more inept than the other woods i ve watched however being from the reefer madness 1938 school of film making glen or glenda doesn t come across as readily enjoyable as his genre efforts also this surely emerges as horror legend bela lugosi s nadir his first of three collaborations with the director one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was considering the actor s history of heavy medication and the sheer senselessness of his cameo besides lugosi s idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward here though wood s script is mostly to blame for this given the impossible dialogue with repeated nonsensical allusions to puppy dog tails and big fat snails he handed the ailing star by the way wood himself plays the central role under the pseudonym daniel davis and being just as worthless in this area proves to have been an all round dog dolores fuller his wife and co star was similarly untalented she would also appear in jail bait 1954 but at the very least the image where the latter finally lets glen wear her angora sweater did give tim burton s affectionate biopic ed wood 1994 its famous poster incidentally the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between wood and orson welles well for all intents and purposes glen or glenda constitutes ed wood s citizen kane 1941 given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques in fact the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore many of it irrelevant such as the bewildering instances of s m and inane dream sequences highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make martin scorsese weep with envy the film s sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the affliction phenomenon of transvestism is however sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach for what it s worth the edition i watched was the extended re issue version which included six minutes of depraved footage directed by w merle connell censored on original release furthermore my copy went out of synch every so often which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track though thankfully this was the fault of the source conversion to divx as opposed to the film itself 
305,in the early to mid 1970 s clifford irving proposed to write the ultimate biography of howard hughes claiming to have spent months preparing for the book engaged in interviews with the reclusive millionaire when all of this turned out to be false irving was accused of perjury spent several years behind bars although always admitting his findings were accurate flash forward to 20001 several months prior to september 11th a book entitled forbidden love published in the u s as honor lost love and death in modern day jordan by a previously unknown author by the name of norma khouri a woman from jordan who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend dalia due to the fact that dalia being from a devout muslim background was dating a christian man it like irving s biography on hughes was revealed as a potential hoax australian film maker anna broinowski attempts to delve into the quagmire that was khouri s attempts to clear herself of the lie s over the time frame of 104 minutes the film attempts to reveal is norma khouri telling the truth or is she just a compulsive liar with an agenda vendetta of her own interview footage with those who know knew her including an ex husband her publisher and others tell their side of the story this is a toothsome well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties not rated but contains pervasive bad language a re enactment of the grisly murder scene played over a few times but nothing nearly as graphic disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic such as saw part 84 not a good choice for the little ones :P
386,oh man i know what your thinking with a title like that i can t go wrong uh yes you can i too loved the title but man i hated the stupid kid that played satan s little helper i hated the mom too and the sister daughter and her boyfriend i hated all those people man it was agony watching this sometimes the only reason this doesn t get 1 10 is becuz condsidering the low budget they did ok but oh man did i hate those actors so stupid i knew it was going to be bad i guess they saved a lot of money on just using halloween masks for the killer and the jesus costume at the end was really stupid too oh the agony do not watch 
886,i saw this play on showtime some years back in the comfort of my home and when the final note was struck i wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a standing ovation as it was i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs for my birthday my kids bought me the vhs version as well as the cd of the play with len cariou in the sweeny todd role i ve shared the play with many some finding the subject a bit sick but none having anything but praise for the songs i ve always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george hearn as well as hearn and edmund lyndeck as judge turpin i must own the dvd 
325,the impossibly sexy rosie holotik plays charlotte beale a new nurse at one of those movie type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own unorthodox ways of treating the inmates reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious dr masters anne macadams a k a annabelle weenick the inmates don t take too kindly to charlotte either part mystery part horror this initial effort from b movie director s f brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it these colorful psychos including a nymphomaniac with no self esteem a gentle giant who s already had a lobotomy and a supposed judge who speaks in legalese jargon dominate the screen with their unnerving presence it s a picture that works fairly well establishing the gritty grim atmosphere right from the get go some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality it builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity offering one surreal encounter after another particularly effective is the poetry quoting dotty old mrs callingham for cheap 1970 s era cheese it s pretty effective with a particularly nasty climax i had a pretty good time watching it 7 10
501,this is a great ending to the show the fact that adm janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected thus infecting the queen with a poison that in essence ended the borg was great the way they ended it also left some not a lot for a reunion movie however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom and b lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today 
626,never when i was a child did i love any movie more then this one i would love to own it i watched it every sunday they played it on the family film festival it is an enjoyable film suitable for the whole family and the songs are wonderful 
45,i was one of the few non liberals who showed up to see steve s video it was quite an experience in propaganda film making and boredom i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moore s visit to my local school uvsc but it turned out to be another liberal slash and burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community it sure seems self serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues what s more surprising is to see all the 10 votes his homeys have posted here did they even see the video golly gee batman this must rank with all the president s men their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film yeah like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie maybe my vote will help balance this out 
306,i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill jackie kennedy s sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the maysles to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women i d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating i e are they nuts or am i missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it facets does though 
315,this is a stereotype plot a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight the fights are not of high standards they are way too simple in a way that 1 1 is simple to every adult the fighter has trained and enters the ring but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking the coach yells do this and do that with no success and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once this results in a turning point in the fight although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point think about the rocky movies and you ll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes the fights are also shot poorly there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment these guys really could have made some quality entertainment but the director wasn t up to the task or the other crew in my opinion maybe they had a small budget i don t know but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10 
156,oh cgi a blessing when used properly a sin with it s used by people who have no idea what their doing sadly that s not the only thing that s used poorly in this umpteen jaws rip off ok anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things 1 i like low budget horror movies and 2 if there is a cute guy in said low budget movie i ll usually point them out so let s just get this out of the way right now this is one low budget horror movie i didn t like the acting for the most part is horrible effects laughable and the script rivals battlefield earth as the worst i ve witnessed this year as far as the resident cute boy dax miller bog wins that prize hands down this boy is hot and surprisingly he s not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt he can actually act well as much as he can in this odious film now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way let s get on with it in cliff notes version here s the story don t worry i ll try not to give anything away a film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers established cute boy and his buddy who surf with sharks unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island croc shows up mayhem ensues and people are eaten roll end credits as i said earlier this film pretty much blows it started pretty well but soon devolved into being silly and stupid a main character becomes lunch in a rather humorous way and our remaining heros utter one liners at the victims expense also if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water what s with all the sharks around if this thing can eat a 40 foot boat i don t think a few skimpy sharks would stick around the fx is some of the worst i have ever had the displeasure to see the cgi is horrendous and they ve even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs attention filmmakers national geographic discovery store the croc hunter they know what crocodiles look like you obviously didn t reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film and what s with the pirate drug pusher gang did you just need another reason to rip off a woman s top it s funny how we get little sub genres in the movie world with alligator and it s sequels lake placid crocodile and now blood surf it now looks like over sized crocodile alligator movies should now get their own category at blockbuster alligator was good lake placid was good i even thought tobe hooper s crocodile was good blood surf sucked my grade d 
718,there are films that are not released in theaters but on video this one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does no story inept violence over acted badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film and i did like and enjoyed some of siegel s other movies 
302,i don t pretend to be a huge asterix fan having only seen one other movie adaption and read only two of the comics but this was a superb movie all the same i only saw the english version and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters brad garret as obelix and sean astin as justforkix especially the story itself was both interesting and truly funny especially the contradicting name endings all the viking names end in af while all the gaulish names of course end in ix with a little romance thrown in that i though enhanced the story even though it weighed down the overall production with unnecessary clichés the plot is this the viking chief timandahaf is sick and tired of going to raid villages and then finding them emptied so he consults his wise man cryptograf whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs and cryptograf tells him that fear lends the villagers wings taking this literally timandahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly and sets out on an expedition to retrieve the champion of fear an expedition that of course leads him to the gaulish village where asterix and obelix live the pair are currently very frustrated chief vitalstatistix s cowardly pacifist nephew justforkix has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man and the boy is making little to no progress when justforkix unwittingly confesses to being afraid of everything in the presence of the brainless viking olaf he is believed to be the champion of fear and is kidnapped asterix and obelix are sent by vitalstatistix to go rescue justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home ultimately this is a great movie with few flaws besides the clichés and at times defective dialogs i thoroughly enjoyed it despite the fact that it wasn t true to the comic 
92,grey gardens is shocking amusing sad and mesmerizing i watched in amazement as ediths jr and sr bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past their existence in a dilapidated mansion which they had not left for more than fifteen years is both a comedy and a tragedy this is a film you will not soon forget 
939,jeff fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous therefore it doesn t really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away drew barrymore fresh off her acclaimed role as poison ivy must have done this film simply as a favor to director phedon papamichael he was the cinematographer on ivy playing a character named daisy drew she s bumped off right away which leaves us with no one to look at but jeff fahey and sean young who hasn t had a single subtle moment on camera since blade runner this witless script by michael angeli concerns a police sketch artist who draws his own wife s face from a murder witness s testimony and while that s not a bad idea for a plot it would be much better suited to an hour long tv series this cable made movie is short on inspiration beginning with the casting and shorter on surprises from 
415,as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists we all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world but unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie the fact that this movie won a couple of bafta s shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even worse this movie is so bad i wouldn t even bother renting it from the weeklies section do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth 
126,why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie burt reynolds peaked then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero and here loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and 48 hours with this family adventure flick which is an unbelievably tedious childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis s great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film the story is pure humdrum it concerns social worker murphy contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one chosen for what i hear you ask his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world as the main demon classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film but hey i m sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents of all murphy s films this is easily the worst i ve read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role in a non formulaic kind of film and while both points are loosely true there s no forgiving the fact that the film however atypical and non formulaic it might be is an absolute load of garbage 
37,dressed to kill starts off with kate miller angie dickinson having a sexually explicit nightmare later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr robert elliott michael caine for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated unfulfilled in her current marriage kate then visits a museum picks up a stranger they go back to his apartment for casual sex when done kate is set to leave but is attacked killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman prostitute liz blake nancy allen discovers the gruesome scene sees the killer but manages to escape detective marino dennis franz says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate s son peter keith gordon to track down the real killer clear liz s name see that justice is done written directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery the script is measured slow at times but it likes to focus on the character s so you really know them the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off then the film switches it s attentions to liz no one else gets a look in this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing engaging unfortunately the character s themselves aren t exactly likable i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you d have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill it s a good film but it didn t excite me that much i didn t really find any character to root for or like the film tacks on a needless unnecessary twist ending that i didn t really see the point of director de palma directs with style visual flair from the art museum sequence to a car chase as a whole it s impeccably filmed throughout i d imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it i felt the film was a bit flat uninspired at times though nothing about it really excited me that much there is a fair bit of nudity some sex rape along with a few bits of gore violence kate s murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight if that s the right word however it s by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe with a supposed budget of about 6 500 000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film the new york locations are nice the cinematography is good as a whole it s extremely well made i thought the music was inappropriate was far to loud intrusive the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn t think caine had that much screen time allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them this blow out 1981 he cast her as a prostitute a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn t think it quite lived up to it s lofty reputation good but not brilliant 
167,antwone fisher s story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children abandoned by a troubled mother antwone has never met his father growing up with church going abusers who use the n word not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a term of endearment as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold up enduring racial slurs and being teased while serving in the navy antwone s anger is slowly turned into positive power when counseled by a navy psychiatrist and a love enters his life the scene where antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film stunned by the unexpected confrontation the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life without crime addictions to drugs fathering children left and right all despite his utterly adverse circumstances if that scene wasn t powerful enough the very next one drives it home and opens the flood gates a reception to welcome home antwone dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that he is part of this great family one of the messages delivered by this wonderful film is that there are many well meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and unwanted children even if some of the homes and administrators don t seem to care and appear self serving many do give it their all the character who found antwone s file once he disclosed the circumstances of his birth is one of those bright lights in the darkness of the system the dvd includes a french language track various subtitle choices as well as additional features and information about foster parenting as a clevelander i appreciated the location footage no matter where you are from you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem 
303,although i have to admit i laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies i saw the budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors the production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch reminds me of the robot monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on in one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off geez hard to believe but the black knight scene from holy grail was more realistic i kept wondering why the victim didn t start shouting none shall pass and it s only a flesh wound i ve had worse it was one of the funniest scenes i ve seen in the past year the gladiator demon was a stitch too between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film 
831,i never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re runs i actually enjoyed it for the first to third season once i saw the fourth and fifth one i was beginning to get irate the first problem was that they did that irrelevant scenario of history repeating itself jr having a kid like his parents did the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone ex katie and franklin the third one was when they made jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where i wanted to go into the t v and beat the stupidity out of him until he s unconscious the fourth one had to be that zealous dork that clarie claimed as a boyfriend the fifth one had to be katie she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her boyfriend franklin like the pushover he was the last but not least was noah gray cabey franklin franklin was just scary it was like watching a terrible combination of urkle and tj henderson only more annoying they seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show there was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that noah can t act eveytime i saw that kid just made me want slap he silly however b f before frank this show was funny and very entertaining 
272,it s the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others success here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier dracula 1931 and frankenstein 1931 in a germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires in the shape of bats have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims even though shot at universal and at the bronson caves it s a poverty row feature it s not fair to compare it with those earlier more expensively made and superior films from the familiar and exciting chilling music of the main titles which must have been by mischa bakalienikoff through the talky but well done opening sequence we anticipate the arrival of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye to give us a good 30s mystery film unfortunately it doesn t happen that s the disappointment we get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing low budget not enough of dwight frye the overdone presence of maude eburne aunt gussie and the premise for lionel atwill dr von niemann to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant emil robert frazier never made very clear do not watch the technicolor dr x 1932 which also stars lionel atwill and fay wray but as father and daughter before watching this the way i did it s an oscar winner by comparison so watch this one first structurally the vampire bat still isn t that good it plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy besides dr x and mystery of the wax museum both 1932 and co starring fay wray lionel atwill s most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in son of frankenstein 1939 and as moriarity in sherlock holmes and the secret weapon 1943 dwight frye steals all his manic scenes in dracula 1931 as the young lovers melvin douglas and fay wray have a nice kissing scene but that s about it he can be seen in the old dark house 1932 and fay gets dragged around by joel mccrea in the most dangerous game 1930 then there s her 1933 classic screamer too bad more time money and rewrites weren t available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye sadly then this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4 
983,anyone who visited drive ins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films wherever movie goers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the 50s came horror movies like voodoo woman and the undead in the 60s were frankie avalon annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like the glory stompers and into the 70s aip churned out grindhouse level trash like cannibal girls and sugar hill dillinger released in 1973 is one of the more highbrow aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriter director john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career the 109 minute dillinger epic for aip s scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in 1933 4 dillinger is basically a chase film with purvis s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover dillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillinger s strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn t there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967 s bonnie and clyde but we simply don t get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shoot em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail aside from this the picture s main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger is just a film it s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as milius s screenplay and the film s documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldn t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them warren oates s performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it s really too bad that milius s screenplay didn t flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a briefly appearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talent as a piece of 1970s exploitation dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgm s dvd release for 4 99 the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts the film doesn t really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre it s certainly worth checking out out of 4roving reviewer www geocities com paul_johnr
705,the annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story it s something i would have done my 1st year in film school very sad additionally the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story which makes me feel that the creative team didn t really know what they were doing or just that it should have been shorter which would have been a blessing not a crime as i have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week i d have to say that this was by far the worst and i just wanted to warn others not to start with this one 
525,i really liked this movie but the ads i saw implied and one published review actually said that this movie benefits from a light touch that to me is very misleading there is indeed plenty of humor eccentric un subtle sometimes somewhat twisted humor the kind of humor i generally find very appealing indeed but most of the humor is the kind that appears conscious at all times of things deeply serious deeply sensitive even deeply painful the movie weaves together themes of past and present perception and truth memory and activity life and death the entire movie is suffused by the history of european anti semiticism in general and of the holocaust in particular how can humor and horror be combined in the same movie the review i saw suggested that the humor is absurdist i don t think this is the case at all at least not in the common sense instead i think this movie stands in the tradition of much jewish yiddish literature and theatre i don t claim to be any kind of expert in this area but from what i ve seen humor is used in this cultural context both as a coping tool for the horribly tragic experiences of this people and also humor is used as a means of recovering the divine for men and women who choose a path of faith rather than a path of either despair or absurdism see fiddler on the roof for humor used in both ways in this rich tradition elijah wood jonathon wood wears horn rimmed glasses that really make him look well strange compare sin city when he wore the same kinds of glasses with chilling effect in this movie it s easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his search and for his struggle between perception and truth eugene hutz young alex and boris lesking old alex are both really just wonderful jonathon and young alex are from the same generation yet seem so very very different and then find that they are not so different after all and the way in which the apparent narrative voice changes gradually from that of jonathon to that of young alex as a journey of intended discovery for jonathon becomes one of discovery for both young alex and old alex is to me so very moving there are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from i m told prague and environs standing in for the ukraine of the story line all feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place although i ve never been myself to the ukraine and can hardly testify to this from first hand experience all in all if you re looking for light comedy i would not recommend this movie at all on the other hand if you are interested in a wonderful delightful and deeply moving film please check out this wonderful movie 
888,this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward furlong terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago i ve watched it at least 20 times the plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines on the plus side it s the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldn t believe how terrible the movie was i think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies 
695,this is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good even though some of the actors and actresses weren t very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old it was funny gross and just all out a very good movie in most parts i just didn t know what was going to happen next i was like i think this is going to happen wait i think this is going to happen all age groups will love this movie in some parts i couldn t stop laughing it was so funny but in some parts i was totally grossed out and i couldn t believe what i was seeing i am definitely going to see this movie again it is one of those movies where it can t get boring every time you see it is so suspenseful i definitely recommend seeing this movie 
782,when a man who doesn t have alzheimer s can t remember how many films he s made he probably is the world s most prolific director after all that man is jesus franco the king of so called eurotrash his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed opaque stupid lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word the film s title is misleading for starters as any other franco film i ve seen that makes it sound pretty awful and it is yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility a generous way with the baldly outrageous with nudity and sleaze and violence and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out even while you re mostly waiting for them to end because they re so very tedious devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america there s lots of naked writhing dancing and endless repeated zoom ins on an ugly totem pole you need to get used to the repetitive zoom ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away as these are franco s main methods of extending a film out to feature length the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning apparently recorded in an echo chamber early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree and it s hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach or her genitals sweet jesus anyway the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers the flakey guy has an accent which as dubbed is half brooklyn american half english liverpudlian and all retarded all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest not too much really happens from here on in and it happens pretty sluggishly studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape the nebulous action is fleshed out haha by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads and even from the monster himself that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero but it s gotta be done at some point and it s nice to note that the director will show anyone s genitals on camera the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film making but he doesn t muck around with sets you get real islands jungles helicopters and mountains all in widescreen this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam ultimately issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot if you re trying to see all the video nasties you will have to watch this at some point and you ll be made as restless as i was if you like franco you ll watch this anyway if you fall into neither of the above categories the odds are you ll never come across this film copies of it aren t just lying around and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it it s franco lazy crazy franco 
991,there s some very clever humour in this film which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors however after a while it just seems an exercise in style notwithstanding great gags such as balasko continuing the part of dussolier and very good acting by all involved and i was wondering why blier made this film all is revealed in the ending when blier directing claude brasseur gets a phone call from his dad bernard blier from heaven and gets the chance to say how much he misses him an effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt but there isn t really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it s entire running time some really nice scenes and sequences however and anyone who likes these mosntres sacrés of the french cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film 
208,the only footage of zeppelin i ve seen prior to this dvd is the song remains the same movie from 1976 we used to spend hours round a friends house watching this but i never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences so what of this dvd i didn t know it existed until browsing for the physical graffiti cd when did this come out i thoughtfor some reason i thought that page wasn t a great live guitarist but to say that watching this dvd has changed my opinion is a massive understatement there s white summer from 1970 10 minutes of guitar wizardry there s an acoustic set from 1975 bron y aur stomp has a brilliant finger picking improv section the in my time of dying and trampled underfoot performances also from 75 are breathtaking with page and bonham tearing things to pieces like no one else ever has demonic possessions of rawk the magic continues into the knebworth 1979 section the rendition of achillies last stand considering their various drug addled states just beggars belief a song of complex guitar overdubs page arranged it in a way that lets him just punk it out live the effect is totally mesmerising in the evening i never liked this on disc but it zings along here sick again great piece of sleaze rock the footage from knebworth is very interesting cutting between big screen various rostrums and bootleg footage to great effect plant is amazing throughout all the performances page despite being painfully thin looks like a six year old kid having the most fun of his life at the knebworth concert and makes infectious viewing one thing that puzzled me the black dog performance from 1973 sounds very camped up robert plant always did love a little mince and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous and would warrant an arrest nowadays all very different from the muscle bound kick a studio version i love this dvd it has reminded me how good zeppelin were and remain 
239,the story line has been rehashed a number of times a breath of life in the retirement home several plays movies novels short stories poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end but it s still an excellent platform for character studies if gideon was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches even the subtitle and summary of gideon s simple wisdom almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors lack of focus almost irrelevant 
148,films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all films to me in the hands of an insightful artist who examines all the twisted little details of the mundane the french cinema seems to often be very good at this sort of thing and i love the french cinema this film was about the mundane it didn t have a much of a plot it was just characters who lived in a town very normal people and stuff just happened but it wasn t very interesting stuff and it wasn t examined very insightfully the film did capture a bit of a mood but it wasn t a particularly captivating mood and while i can t think of much that the film did specifically wrong it failed on just about every level to do anything right there were a lot of characters in this film a lot of them kind of looked alike so it was hard to figure out who was who and what were their relations to one another i don t mind putting some effort into understanding a film or even watching an especially complex film more than one time to iron out the details but this one was a puzzle not worth the solving for me the only good thing i can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasant functional not brilliant but pleasant the camera often captured some nice postcard type shots but it rarely found the really interesting little details i ve seen a handful of not so good films so far at the seattle international film festival but this was the only one that failed to get any applause when the credits rolled i sensed a big collective sigh of relief when the film was finally over but i suppose there are probably some people out there who would like it 4 10
532,walter matthau and jack lemmon both of whom are sadly missed proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen this film is just another example of this this time out they play two brothers in law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board of course their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named gil godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys it s hilarious how lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat s owner rue mclanahan too bad that fellow dance instructors hal linden and donald o connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that matthau falls for dyan cannon on board with her fellow gold digging mother the usual outrageous elaine stritch unknown to them matthau has no money either the widower lemmon falls for gloria de haven looking lovelier than ever the film belongs to matthau and lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers 
954,this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron the acting is second rate poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film and god help gina gershon her accent is too over the top it sounds nothing like an true english woman it sounds forced and phony much like her acting she should stick to what she does best lesbian showgirl con artist who plays in a rock roll band and has a drug problem the other characters are no better they are two dimensional empty vapid and silly how are we to supposed to care about these people at one point christy scott cashman get s lost in central park really it s not that hard to navigate central park just follow any path out not only did i not care about any of the characters i downright hated them the only reason i even stayed with this train wreck of a film was fisher stevens even his brilliant humor couldn t save this dying fish each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us the script was awful as was the acting if you catch this fish throw it back 
245,this is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on this movie is practically mchale s navy for the 90s or police academy at sea grammer proves he can play roles other than frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the navy in order to get his own sub rob schneider is as wormy as usual the same in every role he plays and lauren holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain ken hudson campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase the movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non predictable script that still surprises me every time i watch it many of the navy phrases and terms go over my head though but it s a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters 
104,first of all this was not a three hour movie two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials aren t actually part of a movie perhaps though it should ve been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but i m not so sure that s a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didn t need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sad anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints the actress who played viv vance not great casting at all and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she s a whole new person that wasn t too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy desi no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn t necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy desi had there been more time had the story been more about lucy s entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more but they weren t so we got to see the likes of gable lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucy s life really neat and it s too bad that wasn t explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i don t think i ll ever watch this again and i don t think this movie ll be that memorable for someone who digs i love lucy but isn t an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b
922,why has this not been released i kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn t been how wrong can a girl be this film is in a word enthralling you will be captivated it holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows the final part of the film the episode as it were not giving anything away you saw that in the trailer is also unmissable you will chose a favourite you will be shocked you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens the adrenalin rises and you cant not watch cudos to the actors it s very believable and it doesn t stop there they have a final shock for you it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch and how far away from this are we really endemol who make big brother made a tv show in holland last year offering a dying woman s kidney to patients in need of a transplant the show was revealed at the end to be a hoax ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation but are we getting too close for comfort 
787,i ve just finished viewing the 1st disc in a 4 disc 26 episodes collection created in conjunction with the ucla film television archive s more entertainment inc so far aside from the 1st episode the image quality is quite good the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdb mr peepers is just as charming as when i first saw it 5 years old at the time and wally cox is truly endearing in this role if you re in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head you ll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood although some of the gags are a bit corny most are ingenious and well executed and even the corny ones are fun this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it 
575,okay so i m not a big video game buff but was the game house of the dead really famous enough to make a movie from sure they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie as though justifying any particular scene of violence but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same with the hand in the bottom on the screen supposedly your own holding whatever weapon and goo ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be it s an interesting premise in house of the dead with a lot of college kids loaded college kids as it were kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like 1 500 just for a ride after they miss their boat trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year the first thing that comes to mind about house of the dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations at least in this case the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed they look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter tops but at least they thought they were dressed for the occasion clint howard tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far delivers an absolutely awful performance the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie i can t stand it when well known actors change their accents in movies it is so rarely effective and howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well known actor pretend that he s this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air he didn t even rasp well it sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something real tough there clint i expected more from him but then again he did agree to a part in this mess once we get to the island the movie temporarily turns into any one of the friday the 13th movies that took place at camp crystal lake lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed the nudity was impressive i guess but let s consider something for a minute these kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the rave of the year find no one and say well who wants a beer even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn t think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight here you have the input from director uwe boll there s alcohol they won t notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves so not only do they start drinking not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they re alone it s like they expected to find the island empty and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while they would have some privacy since there s no one else around brilliant now for the things that everyone hated judging by the reviews that i ve read about the movie yes intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie mostly in order to show that yes the movie was being faithful to directly copying the video game sure it was a stupid idea i can t imagine who thought up that little nugget but worse than that is the matrix style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over after the first time at which point i found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film one of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans who are much faster but getting tired running out of places to run and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with the first two are done right in the movie the kids are terrified and don t have a lot of places to run since they re on an island but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler they find themselves heavily armed and i mean that very strongly i mean these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead then you have what i call the techno slasher scene since the rave never happened and i guess since uwe boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie there s one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video there s techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it s nothing but a blur of gory shot mostly only about 5 frames long which is about 1 6 of a second flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music clever i guess but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross out effect because you can t see any one thing for long enough to react to it you re just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie i ve seen a lot of people compare this movie to resident evil mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it and they re exactly right i appreciate that at least here as was not the case in resident evil it wasn t some man made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires 28 days later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie it s just too bad that house of the dead didn t do a single original thing except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based just in case you forget i really think that this should have been a much better movie while obviously i can t say that i know much about the game it s based on just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie but unfortunately i think that s more often the case than not with horror movies it s really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no holds barred horror film and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot which suggests the possibility of a sequel 
483,where to begin how best to describe just how awful this movie is let s start with the campy hick humor it isn t very funny add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse pity poor art carney who should have known better than to do this movie and then there is the plot a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper at least they get what they want and then just when the movie should end they can t come up with a more plausible last scene than a well i won t ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a b movie or perhaps worse gailard sartain is one of them for me and he has a more prominent role that s a sure sign that the movie probably won t be very good if nothing else the movie lives up to the low expectations even exceeds them by being worse than poor let s just say this this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared and none are worse than roadie 
613,i think this movie has got it all it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head it has cool looking characters is really funny you know the kind that you ll crack up on the ground and you ll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks despite the bad acting bad cgi and bad story about cops going after a robot its really cool its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch get together eat pizza laugh like crazy and watch it two more times there are so many funny parts like when kurt was trying to get edison s attention and gave him the finger and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball on that part i kept saying remember remember to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened there was also a really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was there just before they fought and kurt was talking about his strange dream and how he was superman i loved that part although it has been a while since i saw it so i don t remember that part everything the actors said were funny like how kurt says i worship you like a god to the robot although there was some bad things in all it was a great movie man i can t stop laughing i wish i had that movie 
435,one should not be too critical about the director s second feature i really like the camera work of madiba as mr shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at things however howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images remember he has not got any education of any sort i don t think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos worse still madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14 any way if you overcome above mentioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work 
175,publicity got me to the theatreadvice will take you away from this waist of time very bad everything do you really want to see a monkey talking with a technological device x
837,brad pitt sticks his index finger in diane kruger s leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants funny horribly so the invented yarn takes the dirty dozen for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies lots of fun even paris when it sizzles is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog i was thrilled by christoph waltzer s character and by his sensational performance brad pitt creates a true original i love the actor s lack of vanity there s a quirk in the character that is pure brad pitt tarantino visits a new universe but fortunately his hand his brain and his heart are visible all over the place 
513,this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to directing destiny decided that this was indeed his last and what a film rouge the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and durenmatt immediately comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have staged little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a study in red as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene jacob and jean louis trintignant the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age a great film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape 9 10 on my personal scale 
867,wow i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent cliché about the police this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time a perfect tradeoff 
418,first of all season 1 is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional they re nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchair bound augustus hill who is played impressively by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what s taking place in the show unfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a men s club with guards guards that don t do much near the end of season two an older prisoner s grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of 20 and 50 bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even adibisi wanted to be nice but that s okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distraction later shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators let s see what else shillinger s son od s in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he just got them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise you ll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums i didn t know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr faraj s schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and o reilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a gun i shouldn t go on about stupid ideas in this show but it s like a flood i can t stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who can t speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless they re needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robson s gum transplant what s the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesn t belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again it s like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasn t bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mind i also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they don t say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you don t think i m gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience won t remember maybe i m spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a low budget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multi season tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i don t understand myself 
161,dumb excuse for a thriller with absolutely zero chemistry or reason in relationship between lewis and hurt why is she dating a man old enough to be her father anyway the suspense is laughable lewis is very good but a script is needed and there isn t one my score for this trash 2 out of 10 
136,this movie gives golf a high mark it was well acted and well directed giving you a view of history that some non sports fans will enjoy the historic factor alone gives it a high rating the brookline golf course was really done well i am in the northeast and have seen brookline as a fan and as someone who loves the game the movie was well done on all levels a must see 5 stars the acting was superb disney has another winner in its bag of great movies if for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life i would tell you that the setting while in the late 1800 s and early 1900 s is very realistic the costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film a must see for fans and non fans alike 
774,this film was very interesting to me virtually a film within a film which is about a very whimsical director who cleverly persuades an actress and and actor who happen to dislike each other in producing sexual chemistry on film the director is faced with a fusillade of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film sex is comedy is much more than a comedy packed with uncomfortable quirky moments the movie also addresses the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women in regards to the sometimes controversial act of sex i loved this film the character jeanne played by the beautiful anne parillaud performs wonderfully on screen as you share in her struggle to produce a motion picture work of art 
56,when the italians and miles o keeffe work together nothing can go wrong as ever miles is great as the almost as great ator the most lovable barbarian of all times totally lives up to the first movie 
252,pushing daisies truly is a landmark in television as an art form everything seems to pay homage to amelie and tim burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not it is just brilliant i have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the shield and the wire ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of pushing daisies is that it has no comparisons on television truly addictive and an absolute pleasure perhaps like one of the piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways 
804,in sum overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes the director and co writer says he wanted to mix genres in this case drama and comedy well at least here these two mix like vinegar and oil to boot the comedy is not very funny and juvenile additionally the film is not really realistic liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex lover s son by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover marriage of convenience and a nutty ex lover at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them either ismael or primarily nora to the detriment of the audience viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael her ex lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball s chance in hell the actors do their best and are appealing but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing editing and lack of focus 
573,i ve watched almost all of the gundam mech anime that have showed in the us and this by far has the best story the way its plot twists and turns has u riveted gundam wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war the series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as gundams the gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as oz as things begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilots new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate old conflicts will end and new ones will arise to obtain peace the gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting but how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal i recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot 
683,i have seen this movie twice now on cable the first time i saw it it caught me by suprise the skaters i was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of skateboarder magazine back in the late 70 s these were the guys we copied and tried to become while skating i am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be i am almost 40 years old now and i guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life s problems however this film did a great job of taking me back back to the vacant pools the backyard halfpipes and the road trips to cherry hill nj i suspect that in order to really understand this movie and appreciate it you had to live it otherwise it probably won t have the impact on you as it did me but for those of you and you know who you are who did live it you know exactly what i am talking about in any event i don t care who you are if you get a chance to see this movie do it i give thanks to the z boys of dogtown for the memories of my youth and thanks to stacy for making this movie job well done 
111,i tend to fall in and out of love with anime as the more you watch the more you notice a lot of shows are just poor copies of the few gems or rehashes of old formulas but every once in a while one of the true gems comes along and it s originality just blows you away haruhi is truly one of those shows many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation into an animated show is rather poorly done and doesn t utilize the benefits animation has over static drawings haruhi is actually based on a series of light novels and fires on all cylinders beautiful animation great voice acting great music and a complete and well paced story watch it you won t be disappointed and i d suggest watching it in broadcast order it works so much better that way 
93,i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land in a river runs through it redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot serpent s kiss reigne margot redford s cast is perfect tom skerritt is the rev maclean a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible brenda blythen the mother and his sons craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons and later complex young men both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever it is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent years what makes these relationships special however is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue this is a literate script beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not so implausible in redford s directorial hands given the material redford s ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again 
18,master kieslowsky came with an idea in 1993 the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today passing from blue a crafted visual masterpiece about a woman s life from white a visual comedy movie about marriage and finally arriving to red a masterpiece dealing with human interaction while i m not going to spoil the move i can easily say red is the best movie from the 90 s decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script i have ever ever seen the movie begins a little slow but finds it s rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole movie the performances are perfect sublime since the characters are completely realistic and they re not clichéd in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesn t get disappointed seriously i believe jean louis tringtignat deserved an oscar nod at least the music from zbiegnew preisner is amazing it s one of the best musical scores ever piotr sobocinsk cinematography is also outstanding he got an oscar nod for it and deserved to win overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who don t don t miss it how did the awful pulp fiction beat ed this masterpiece at cannes is beyond my comprehension
400,well after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravo s the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film the plot was simple beautiful model alison parker cristina raines moves into an apartment building that s a gateway to hell the sentinel is a down right creepy film even if it s a bit slow it s a mix of the omen and rosemary s baby the acting is fine and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals it s a very odd campy but in the end i truly believe a great film one of my favorites from the 70 s even if it s nothing greatly original it s wacky and extremely creepy probably one of my all time favorites 9 10
975,the big knife a movie about the dark side of the hollywood motion picture industry is ironically far more like a filmed play than a film itself apart from a few very brief expository scenes all of the action takes place in the living room of the film s hero played by jack palance he s a movie actor who wants out of his contract with his studio because of the lack of redeeming qualities in the films they put out his on again off again wife ida lupino is also fed up with the studio not to mention her husband s philandering ways unfortunately for them both the head of the studio rod steiger is a real bastard he has blackmail material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract but it s only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far this film is not i repeat not a film noir rather it s an exceptionally theatrical sitting room melodrama the plot proceeds at a snail s pace and is so intricate and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with the static setting and carefully contrived blocking of the actual scenes the acting is overwrought in the extreme and veers sharply between out and out histrionics and softer but no less unsubtle soliloquies that are obviously meant to be poignant but come across as pretentious twaddle especially in the hands of the woefully miscast palance aldrich was obviously going all out for a stylized something here but i doubt even he knew what it was and certainly the audience never does i think the main lesson here is that films and plays are very different mediums what might have worked in a play did not come across as even remotely natural or plausible on film the result a big waste of time there s little to enjoy here 
930,what a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject there is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight or gay man working in a gay sexual environment the dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic component they may not all be prostitutes for hire but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered from the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the dancers for private sessions even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the dancers only playing to the women in the audience this just isn t the reality of these clubs it would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples so what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients we learn very little instead we get filler a gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers a manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers lives and attitudes the pictures of mexico city are generic the phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous this is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing the rest of the movie is an insult to gay men 
907,as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat 3 i ve purchased that s been made recently i wasn t sure what to expect a cambodian hit man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the arrangements for the hit man because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hit man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hit man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hit man to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie it s like a roller coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit man the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking there s no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off dog eat dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an r1 release for sure great movie highly recommended 
672,the forest isn t just your everyday standard slasher backwoods cannibal fare it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well the story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip a cave dwelling cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them there is something you don t see every slasher director don jones gets an a for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level the acting is just simply average except for jeanette kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman michael brody aka gary kent the film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest they realize too late that someone is stalking them they are both dispatched in typical slasher fare our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife s lover the forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn t work along with it i found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting 4 10
23,alright i have to admit that i have never seen rhoda and only one or two episodes of the mary tyler moore show even though i don t know anything about this duo of comedic talent i still liked this movie a lot mary goes back to work rose tries her luck at being a comedian rhoda struggles with a photography career and meredith what exactly does she do again these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way when the two long time friends reunite it only makes the film better i was surprised about how good the writing was the little jokes thrown in by mary and rhoda were funny the script itself was very well put together i had seen moore and harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie they never seem to let me down during the run of this movie joie lenz and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great the rest of the cast like jonah cecile and everybody else also works well together being that this is a reunion you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this from a non fan i still enjoyed this little get together good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good the newer version of the mtm theme song doesn t hurt either 
997,ed wood is eclipsed and becomes orson welles this film is fantastic vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter plan 9 from outerspace dons t stand a chance against this described by the writer and psychic stephen armourae on the vampire forum as a masterpiece he s from england and thoroughly sarcastic it has stephanie beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers and eileen daly is just a lower rate elvira the whole thing is badly done watch it for the script though
153,i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself am i going crazy can t i see the beauty from a film like this am i just dumb enough to not understand the message this film is trying to point out i don t know maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well the film idea was going nowhere i was sure it would have a foggy end and of course it did nothing exceptional not even the landscapes i hopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice but no just a lame story about a crazy teacher and of course her crazy students now all grown up each of them with his her own fixed ideas and boy some of those ideas were stupid like the lizard story for example at a moment i thought i was watching x files with the lizard entering in the ear and all no from my point of view this movie is a waste of time not to say money if u pay for the ticket the only part that i did like was the acting of the young blue eye german kid he played very well and convincing for his age the rest nothing i read the previous review and i think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film i think to myself again maybe i am the crazy one advice don t waste your time with this 
74,i really liked the movie the emporer s new groove but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having relations with a llama seriously this movie was bad it s like club dread after super troopers i am supposed to write 10 lines but i don t even know what else to say i laughed a couple of times but only because i was drinking a movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk it was not maybe llamas are just funny and regular cartoon people aren t either way just stick with the emporer s new groove if you want a funny cartoon llama themed movie line 10 is this line right here 
127,by 1945 and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces errol flynn s hold over u s box office had started to decline so in spite of the increased burden of waning looks he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler the first of these was a good one actually adventures of don juan 1948 but it also proved to be his last big budget hollywood starring vehicle the rest of his sword wielding days were spent wandering all over europe in england for kim 1950 the master of ballantrae 1953 and the dark avenger 1955 in france for adventures of captain fabian 1951 and italy for the aborted the story of william tell 1953 and the little seen crossed swords 1954 however hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways albeit for a modestly budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers a production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak still the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self his red headed leading lady maureen o hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger than life starring vehicles so here he is typically seen as the baddie the pirate captain roc brasiliano a role he attacks with gusto like the black shield of falworth 1954 a viewing of which preceded this one against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channels for all i know this might well have been the very first pirate movie i ve ever seen and i cringe at the thought of today s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about as i said earlier against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same nowadays the amorous persistence of the child like indian princess alice kelley towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk 1940 and the black swan 1942 to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars is briskly paced and reasonably engaging incidentally the film would later go on to be remade as the king s pirate 1967 with doug mcclure for what it s worth the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and as a matter of fact against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorly thought out pirates of the golden age movie collection set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneer s girl 1950 with yvonne de carlo doule crossbones 1951 with donald o connor and yankee buccaneer 1952 with jeff chandler value for money perhaps but so far i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources even so if the mood strikes me in future i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytyk s mutiny 1952 the afore mentioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga 1961 
771,not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted i will only say this nearly everybody says they loved curly best but i will put brideless groom up against any of other the stooges shorts i think it s the most hilarious from start to finish as well as being the most re watchable the off key singing student christine mcintire s cousin basil routine and of course emil sitka s j p are highlights but only around the stooges impeccable timing and the great writing too nuff said 
365,hard to believe this was directed by fritz lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries this movie has a cast that includes robert young randolph scott dean jagger and john carradine scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving jagger s life jagger works for western union a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about indian attacks and bandits scott is in charge of the men and young is a telegraph expert who can t shoot a gun but can ride scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but scott can t tell anyone it s a pretty good western and lang should of directed some more westerns 
380,i bought this rental return for 1 99 at hollywood and overpaid i didn t expect much but thought it would be something to fall asleep by at least i quickly noted the very weak storyline the gross overacting by everyone no one talks like that except in cartoons and the seemingly let s make it up as we go along direction i know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed by it and i feel certain that it did not help any careers as for this movie buff of 35 years it has now provided a ready answer for the worst film you ve ever seen question 
487,this movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies i have seen the acting was utterly superb and when i wasn t drying my tears i enjoyed meryl streep who s performance was extraordinary the movie deals with the hardships of a distant family coping with a mother who develops terminal cancer the movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking the soundtrack fits this movie to a tee brava bette midler out of 5 stars i give this one 4 1 2 
250,watching josh kornbluth act in this movie reminds me of my freshman tv production class where the not funny had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were obvious is the word that comes to mind when i try to synopsize this wannabe comedy the jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed the delivery is painfully bad ouch the writing is simply dorkish it is akin to a bob saget show watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit post belushi i hated this movie and want my money back 
209, the ballad of the sad café worked hard at its image but when it came down to crunch time it was left standing in its own self created dust one cannot image saying this out loud but if vanessa redgrave s amelia were to fight john wayne or even clint eastwood my hard earned dollars would have to go to redgrave her portrayal of amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multi million dollar contracted persona redgrave gave amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hard earned woman from the south to the average viewer this could be construed as annoying but as the film progressed it became her miss amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck it was redgrave s performance as well as her interaction with the other characters that made this film stand tall but not the tallest the others following her performance were needed but not stellar as we moved past the murky cliché image passed on by every set designer hired for the post depression south job the minor characters felt like poster board the image was needed to set the scene but the characters of the town had no other purpose take for example rod steiger s vision of some old wild spoken preacher his scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this off the beaten path town the main two players who surrounded amelia battled with charm for the admirable top scene stealing moment but due to the lacking direction it just seemed faded the most absurd of the two albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line is cork hubbard who plays amelia s cousin who shows up randomly one night his character is never quite defined he lacks true motive and his loyalties remain uncertain he plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us the viewers to question his sanity and honesty can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue flicking your ears and punching your chest and head finally there is the other end of the absurd keith carradine callow s close ups of this tormented man build character but our lack of understanding between him and amelia causes his purpose to flounder these were the characters as cliché southern as they were some stood forward and attempted to create an absurdist period piece and i cannot argue that they failed where ballad of the sad café failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative this film was about amelia and her need for other souls in her life the audience s level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining one couldn t help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to leech off a warm heart cork hubbard s character is never quite understood but we do accept him with brief shots of him and amelia doing small things together it is his idea that transforms from a recluse businesswoman to a bona fide café owner the problem is that director callow never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between cork and redgrave is the man crazy or does he represent all of amelia s family i needed something from callow that brought these two out of the david lynch esquire relationship that they had then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of carradine as amelia s love interest using the technique of a flashback within a flashback we see the two wed but never consummate their love which amelia s anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness why was amelia so angry why was there no connection between carradine and redgrave why was this even in the film with the lack of focus towards these characters s connection the eventual scenes between the two made no sense throw in cork s choice and it just gets completely discombobulated while there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that callow created the inability to transfer his characters from point a to point b i lost focus interest and my care for the characters plummeted when i didn t understand the ultimate question why overall the ballad of the sad café began with a bang but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker my emotional feel of this film swung up and down up and down and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters redgrave did a phenomenal job as amelia and while the other characters outside of the random steiger tried their best i just didn t quite understand who they were their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred i was apathetic director callow seemed to have been lacking importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the scenery which allowed us to focus on amelia or carradine but nothing was explained or developed the film played out with anger discover happiness flashback anger anger anger fade out without the comparative connectors this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera it was a shame because sad café had the promise it just couldn t deliver grade ½ out of 
609,this documentary is not only one of the best documentaries i ve seen but also one of the most moving and quietly beautiful movies i ve seen period it follows the lives of two sudanese young men peter and santino as they try to make their way into the american culture peter and santino are friends at first but they gradually drift more and more apart as peter goes to kansas city and santino stays in houston a land called houston santino s beauty is in his eyes he takes people onto his back he supports an apartment full of other sudanese paying the rent doing everything for other people he is a quiet sufferer peter looks out for himself getting a high school education while playing basketball and making christian friends it seems that director megan mylan did not know what she was getting herself into with the beauty of this tale peter and santino are amazing characters that move you but the real strength in this movie lies in its commentary on american society it is not judging it shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be to outside people i suggest you find this film and look at america through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people my grade 10 10
125,i m a big time horror fan and i bought this movie from all the hype it was getting on the message boards well let me tell you i don t know whom was giving it all the hype but let me speak on a few things first of all this film is not a lot of things it is not scary not suspenseful not overly gory not overly sick except for one season maybe not beautifully scored at all the premise of the movie is that a couple flee to a small island in greece because they have done a little naughtiness in london we don t even know what they did but it is presumed that they killed someone spoiler alert the male lead kills a few people out of his perversion of cleansing the island of perverts oddly enough the killings are cheap the characters are cheaper and the effects suck there is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning but even that is done without any care for how it is shot end of spoilersthe end of the movie is about the only thing that isn t totally predictable i especially enjoyed when the herder farts on the husband anyway if you can rent this and have 2 hours to waste go ahead it s nothing better than a processed cheese sandwich on moldy bread 3 10
391,after having watched darwin s nightmare one must have the impression of tanzania being a living hell with its population being quasi slaves delivering the finest fish to the well fed europeans while leaving the fish bones to the starving population in exchange for the fish they get western made weapons which the mainly unemployed population eagerly awaits to use because being a soldier is their only source of income so everything is all dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and source of all misery not quite fortunately darwin s nightmare shows the dark sides only and completely spares the positive aspects in fact the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecologic importance the victoriaperch has for the region for the countries around lake victoria the victoriaperch is the second to third most important source of income the wages in the fishing industry are way above average tanzania has banned huge trawlers to secure the jobs of thousands of fishermen the adjacent states have met agreements to keep fishing on a sustainable level cities at the lake are benefiting from the taxes the fishers have to pay for each kilogram caught fish and the taxes on the factories exports and profits furthermore tanzania has banned exporting the local traditional fish which still play an important role feeding the local population by ignoring those positive signs the documentary deters the badly needed western consumers and investors and thus threatens to aggravate the african s situation for further reading i can recommend two articles the german alternative wing newspaper wrote on the subject http www taz de pt 2006 09 02 a0013 1 textdruck http www taz de pt 2005 03 17 a0151 1 text
839,what happened those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen nightmare on elm st had gone noticeably downhill after it s cult classic of a first film but i doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film and nobody is more distraught about it than i am this is by far the worst anoes film of the lot it doesn t seem too bad at the beginning with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather elongated shower scene featuring alice but then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of events i mean sure freddy movies are supposed to be dreamlike and creepy but this one is like a train wreck in it s poor sequencing of events and awful plot setup it feels like you re coming down with a terrible headache not like you re getting scared so the directing totally fails none of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic the death by food especially except for that one cool scene that s crafted like a comic book battle that s why this movie gets a point the storyline lame lame lame lame it was an excuse to gross people out and to make the mpaa mad and nothing more the acting should i mention how freddy has been turned into a childish boogey man like clown figure how his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year old s horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we ve all known and loathed since the first film that arm waving and stupid chuckling as he appeared again ugh and his one liners too throughout the whole movie they suck badly a grade schooler could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit freddy spews throughout the 90 minute duration of the film hell a chimpanzee could come up with much funnier lines than what freddy s been told to say here who wrote the script for this this movie is really irritating too it seems so pointless like a gnat buzzing around your head a gnat that just won t go away freddy is just an annoyance now we ve seen him so many times before this one s nothing different and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one liners and get off your tv screen alice instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie seems annoying and very shallow and this is obviously due to the horrible horrible script this movie was fitted with lisa wilcox may be a great actor and sometimes it shines through the cracks here but she can t save this movie the other actors just suck mostly the last 15 or 20 minutes of freddy s existence in this film are awful and embarrassing i hope englund was ashamed of this who wants to see freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out laughing like a cartoon villain this movie destroyed anything positive i felt for the nightmare series i can t ever watch them again without this image running through my head of the mangled cartoon abomination that krueger became he was slowly becoming a jokey retarded pop culture icon but this is the lowest of the low this is rock bottom nobody will ever take freddy krueger seriously again after seeing this film he s naught but a joke a clown that is long overdue for retirement pathetic of all the movies i could hate why did it have to be nightmare on elm st a series which i once adored and liked a lot the dream child represents the death of a legend and the shattering of any hope i had in the nightmare on elm st series freddy would go on to continue his downward spiral into clown status in the next installment freddy s dead which was more entertaining than this was actually and then he would go on to bring down the mood in freddy vs jason and finally he would putter out into nothing which is for the best i know this has mostly been a rant about why freddy sucks now but this movie is overall horrible and one of the worst movies ever made not recommended to anyone and even anoes completionists won t want to see this one again 
669,i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall i liked it it showed great potential i guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together by the filmmaker s own admission on the official site the short was exhibited as a rough cut but nonetheless it was an easy going comedy i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy all they are supposed to do is make you laugh that s all i did just that at its showing so it succeeded on that level just my 2 cents anyway 
466,this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in abbott and costello meet frankentstein it was a somewhat desparate yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man frankenstein s monster and dracula one last time i say desparate because in the previous film house of frankenstein both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be dracula by the sunlight and the wolf man by a silver bullet yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn t be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein and if the wolf man didn t get cured then there d be no plot holes but since this is not the case the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense however ignoring these plot holes house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that s fun to watch it has many high points especially seeing the wolf man get cured i know i just said that this shouldn t have been included but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time and the scene with the lady playing moonlight senada on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under dracula s spell was very eerie dr edleman s transformation into the dr jekyl mr hyde type character was also done very well and it s great to see dracula frankenstein and the wolf man together one last time out of 
83,if you are viewing this show for the first time you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality colorful and imaginative characters entertaining dialogue plots that seem to have some depth to them even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times i mean this is a syndicated children s show right this is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as pokemon pepper ann mighty morphin power rangers and vr troopers please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese exports courtesy of the fox network and saban entertainment don t worry you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s some examples of this period would be transformers garfield and friends captain power and c o p s a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox besides these prime examples disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids coming up with a lineup called the disney afternoon aside from a dumbed down show called the gummi bears early shows like darkwing duck duck tales and chip n dale s rescue rangers gave credence to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like the little mermaid beauty and the beast the rescuers down under and the great mouse detective but above all these wonders shines talespin the premiere of plunder and lightning was a two hour thrill ride and won an emmy much to my delight the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere while i enjoy the plots and dialogue i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters there s rebecca cunningham an independent female but still fallible kit cloudkicker full of pre teen angst and optimism louie with his loyalty and support frank wildcat the most entertaining engineer since scotty on the original star trek molly cunningham cute and witty but with some depth that most child characters don t have and of course in the middle of it all there s baloo whom i would describe as a slobby version of james bond this is because whenever there s trouble baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker than most fastest of all sea duck read james bond s aston martin of course every great show has to have great villains and talespin doesn t disappoint here either from the megalomania of businesstiger shere kahn to the vain and always failing air pirate don karnage to the hilarious and inept soviet satirized thembrians the animation is good the music appropriate and the episodes are for me the finest that children s programming has ever had to offer great fun for the whole family 
928,i have to say i totally loved the movie it had it s funny moments some heartwarming parts just all around good me personally really liked the movie because it s something that finally i can relate to my childhood this movie in my opinion is geared more towards the young gay population it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up all the taunting name calling and not knowing is something i like most other young feminine boys will always remember and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay so i would definitely recommend seeing this movie probably shouldn t really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
447,saxophonist ronnie bowers dick powell wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood he stays at hollywwod hotel of course at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall lola lane has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia rosemary lane to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him it s not marshall naturally they fall in love you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself the plot is old to put it nicely but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices the score is good highlighted by hooray for hollywood and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive in musical sequence with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesie still the movie isn t that good the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy also there is racism a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there s some truly appalling racist humor at one point that s probably what keeps this off tv most of the time i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today all in all a so so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs i give it a 7 
262,this is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention it s not going to win any oscars it s really not a very good movie at all heck it s not even really a movie just a string of short disgusting gross out skits strung together in an effort to make entertainment and as much as every critical bone in my body cries out to give this movie a failing score gosh darn it i m going to give it a much better score the kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say so i m not going to give some snobby critique of jackass s quality of surreal existentialism that permeates and commentates on how our society oh forget it what s to say there s no plot development no character development no real beginning there s a semi enjoyable end that s not nearly as funny as the skit that precedes it and everything in between reeks of improper bathroom humor that junior high kids laugh at it s actually pretty funny leave at the door all your preconceptions of a good movie jackass number two is just gross out crap that s really all it is i do give the filmmakers this though they come up with some pretty imaginative stuff you ll probably cringe several times throughout want to throw up a couple times wiggle and shift uncomfortably as the people on screen do death and vomit defying stunts vomit crap urine semen virtually every bodily fluid can be seen in jackass number two there s nudity sexual humor abounds and so on and so forth it s entertaining if you re the kind of person who finds this stuff enjoyable then you will probably really like jackass number two i laughed several times like i said it s pretty imaginative stuff i never once wanted to vomit though i do have a pretty strong stomach just accept the movie s premise a bunch of idiotic guys do weird crap for fun once you get past that accepting it and going with it you ll enjoy it the only flaw in the movie is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting stuff there are several very imaginative very disturbing skits but it drags in many places as they do ones that are less interesting towards the end things pick up but in the middle of the movie the drag hurts the overall film s quality in a half hour tv show this isn t a problem but with film length celluloid it s inevitable that boredom will ensue at some point after awhile the gross crap just becomes desensitizing on the whole though number two is an entertaining imaginative and above all disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain nausea and hilarity go see it if you must but hey if you know you don t like this kind of stuff don t bother you ll just be disappointed 
591,mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere at what looks like a wooden building in the desert a pick up truck pulls up an angry father chucks his slutty daughter virginia monroe claudia christian out leaves her there but she isn t alone as the shadowy figure of nestor duvalier brion james watches her from a short distance virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her leopard print thigh high high heeled boots nestor grabs her by her throat drags her off into the darkness nestor then rips her top open turns into a monster starts to eat her innards virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have lieutenant carlo hendrix art evans the lapd baffled or at least that s the message a local tv news reporter named clay dwyer mark thomas miller is telling his viewers clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend alice mary beth mcdonough therefore his mother emily jeanne bates has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the blind dark sunglass wearing nestor unfortunately for emily she accidentally knocks nestor s sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes nestor then turns into a monster again bites emily turning her into a flesh eating monster just like himself nestor takes emily out to train her they find a suitable homeless bum rory vansaint murder him eat his guts but emily s son clay has witnessed the whole thing he must choose between doing what is right his love for his mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking flesh eating monster edited written directed by patrick rand i thought mom was a pretty awful film looking at some of the other comments on the imdb the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that mom is a comedy horror well i can tell you now that i didn t see any comedic elements in mom at all because there aren t any unless they are very subtle the only thing that i can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which mom presents that being an old lady turning into a flesh eating monster the predictable problems emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out there are no jokes apart from naming a prostitute beverly hills stella stevens slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself as far as i could see it is played totally straight throughout it s 90 minute run time so with there being no comedy in mom that must mean there s lots of horror right wrong mom sucks is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of nestor turning into a monster a couple of times biting emily showing her how to hunt for food clay finding out until this point mom was moving at a fairly decent pace had some ok special make up effects had me interested unfortunately mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by emily s son the eventual breakdown of his marriage him being torn between love for his mother the fact that she s a flesh eating monster this part of the film is incredibly slow boring as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichéd role reversal scenario where clay tells his mom to go to her room stay there locking the door behind her telling her off putting bars over her window so she can t escape her room mom s script totally ignores the monsters origins ask s us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should no matter how silly an explanation might have been i think some background to the monster would have helped technically mom is bland cheap looking although i can t say it s badly made it s very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which i could make fun of to pass the time the special make up effect s on the monster are ok but their used in very quick flashes blink you ll miss them don t be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like i was the monster is only in it three times maximum all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes there isn t much gore either a severed arm some brief intestine eating a burnt body a drill in someone s arm is all we get the acting is ok but please mr brion james what is that dodgy accent all about at least james had the good sense to know he was in crap sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings everyone else are nobodies expect the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in fright night 1985 but you may recognise him from die hard 2 1990 he made mom die hard 2 in the same year talk about opposite ends of the spectrum overall there is nothing by which i can really recommend mom as a horror film it certainly isn t a comedy as far as i m concerned very poor very disappointing yet again i ve been conned by fancy video box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters definitely one to avoid 
732,ok so maybe it s because i m from the north east of scotland and i talk just like the guys in this film but i found this great fun cheap fun to be sure but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all i was actually quite effected when they died in particulare when the captain finally fell the script well it s a game of 2 halfs the opening half of the film is well written and sharp the last half hour is not so great with many questions left unanswered this will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me but nevertheless good fun and a very smart first feature from sturton 
251,this show has come so far at first everyone in the cast from eric to fez they were all new actors and actresses fresh faces and just look what they accomplished they stuck with the show and it was a success its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom i ve ever seen in my life it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show i hope to god that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had i don t care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode go down swinging get one last punch in the show deserves it the fans deserve it if they go let everyone know its going to end like on friends and let the finale be huge i say get donna and eric married i say have hyde and kelso fight and become friends again i say have something interesting happen between fez and jackie because fez has been trying for so long but of course it wont work out for him just close out the series big time guys that 70s show will always be the best in my eyes eric kelso donna jackie fez hyde i wish i had you guys as friends you are the best 10 10 
294,lights of new york was the first all talking feature film there had been of course the jazz singer released in oct 1927 as the first feature film incorporating synchronized dialog however this film released in july 1928 is virtually unremembered for its place in film history it had started out as a short but gradually more was tacked on until clocking in at 58 minutes it accidentally became the first all talking feature film it opened to a grind house run and to warner bros surprise made over a million dollars that was good money back in 1928 the plot is quite simple two country barbers naively buy into a barber shop on broadway that fronts as a speak easy for the hawk a gangster when they learn the truth they can t afford to get out because the younger barber eddie has all of his mother s money tied up in the place kitty is the younger barber s girlfriend and gangster hawk wheeler oakman has an eye for turning in his older girlfriend gladys brockwell for a newer model chorus girl kitty helene costello a cop is killed while trying to stop the hawk s men from unloading a shipment of bootleg liquor and the hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame eddie thus getting kitty for himself this early talkie is loads of fun for the enthusiast of these pioneering works sure the plot is elementary and the dialog stilted but there is something you don t see much of in early talkies background musical scoring vitaphone had originally been used for this very purpose and here they are still using it for musical accompaniment along with the dialog and there are singing and dancing numbers the scenes in hawk s nightclub are used as an opportunity to show off what films could never do before musical numbers there is even a wild eyed emcee with some heavy makeup left over from the silent era that is a hoot to watch vitaphone could not go outdoors at this point due to the static camera booths so the scene in the park between the two lovers eddie and kitty is simulated and cheaply the greenery looks like something out of an ed wood movie or perhaps a high school production of our town gladys brockwell as the hawk s castoff girlfriend delivers her lines with punch she s a real trooper considering what lines she has to deliver to the hawk so you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck huh mixed metaphors anyone and then there are her final lines i ve lived and i ve loved and i ve lost did someone get paid to write this dialog brockwell was making a good success of her talkie career after scoring some triumphs in silent films the evil sister in seventh heaven when a fatal car accident cut her career short then there is eugene palette the older of the two barbers in our story his frog voice natural delivery of lines and cuddly appearance gave him a long career as a character actor usually appearing as a put upon family man businessman with a gruff exterior and heart of gold in fact mr palette is the only member of this cast who still has a notable career in films just three years after this movie is released finally there is the question of where is that microphone hidden microphones were still stationary at this point and it s fun to figure out where they ve hidden it there is one famous scene though where everybody can pretty much figure it out hawk is in his office talking to his two henchman who seem to comprehend as slowly as they talk about taking eddie for a ride if you watch this scene you d swear the phone on the desk is a character in this film it s front and center during the whole conversation the microphone is likely planted in the phone there is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind in the face of the new technology of sound you have silent actors who are accustomed to using pantomime for expression vaudevillians who know how to play to a live audience but don t know how to make the same impression on a vitaphone camera booth and you have dialog writers either trying to write conversation as compactly as they did title cards or filling up films with endless chatter check this one out it is not boring moves fast and is loads of fun if you know what to look for and no i don t expect this one to ever be out on blu ray but i hope that the folks at warner brothers add it to the warner archive soon so everyone can see it 
84,i don t see the point it s ponderous the animated people are creepy look up uncanny valley scenes go on and on and on for very little purpose the plot is skeletal and must be padded out with lots of meaningless dramatic screaming roller coaster rides as if disney or spielberg were planning an amusement park ride based on the movie most of the characters are annoying and unlikeable some of them keep showing up as if they will have something important to add to a climactic scene they don t they just vanish with no lasting impact somebody summed it up as if you don t believe in santa claus you ll be kidnapped on a train on christmas eve that pretty much sums it up 
191,after watching this movie i couldn t help but notice the parallels between it and another film called america 3000 both were very bad mid 1980 s post apocalypse disasters on celluloid obviously fake sets wooden acting and stupid monsters are found in both films about the only difference between the two is that the lead villainess here played by angelika jager has a very thick accent avoid this one unless you re watching the mst3k version joel and the bots barely salvage this turkey 
467,yes be my love was mario lanza s skyrocket to fame and still is popular today his voice was strong and steady so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood i used to practise singing his songs years ago and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysema asthma ten years ago reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful 
506,i myself feel this film is a rare treasure not only is it the beginning of shirley temple s career but a rare look on how our society has changed you have to understand certain things we today would view as sexual back then would be considered innocent for example the parents of the children in the film as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie saw this as just children mimicking adults most people didn t think of anyone viewing children sexually attractive other than teenage boys lusting over teenage girls to them it wasn t sexual mind you this was before we had internet tv etc most sex crimes weren t openly brought up occasionally there would be a whisper about the kid with the funny uncle but that was often all that came of it yes very sad but it is kinda sad today for even i too can see this film as anything other than what it was intended innocent and funny when i saw shirley dance like that and the boys eye balling her yes i felt disturbed i have to remind myself the time this took place those children didn t know what sex was the parents knew that both those of the children in the movie and those watching it the thought may not have even entered their minds in the eyes of the average adult back then this was no more sexual then if shirley was playing house even today kids will enter beauty contest many dressed up extremely maturely for a three yr old however the child is merely pretending i don t blame the child for wanting to act like an adult or the old movies that display this in all honesty our media has made a lot of things seem back then seem sick and wrong this sometimes can be for the best but i truly believe this movie isn t one of them it gives a rare look of an innocent mentality that we have long lost 
852,spoilers following i picked up the book evil angels when it first came out knowing nothing of the case just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain s guilt the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors and picked up by the press of the arterial spray the actelone plates dr james cameron s certainty that the collar was cut with scissors that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up bloody hand print etc all quite convincingly after all these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn t apparent to me at all it was also highly technical evidence difficult for a layman to understand to this point beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didn t believe it was possible the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists whose origins made them appear to be a cult and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt were it not for dedicated selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony finding azaria s clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail the book shook me for that reason and i ve been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone s guilt ever since excepting oj of course i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don t think it could have been done better i ve always liked sam who i could identify with completely and meryl was perfect as always beautiful photography haunting music i think it s not only a very good but a very important movie too bad it didn t receive more publicity at the time it was released 
892,eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in 1985 to totally abysmal now it s such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings the ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting ever characters name in a hat the first two out regardless of their sex will sleep with each other the 3rd 4th out will have a fight in the vic the 5th one will be arrested the 6th develop an addiction 7th get pregnant etc etc the producers are clever though the 30 minute show is only actually ever comprised of 3 lines 1 someone will walk in the vic say what s goin on 2 someone else will stand up say leave it aht out 3 then a woman will say doan choo come in ere n insult mah fam ly that s it that s every show apart from the occasional get it sort id is it sort id the show was once a realistic portrayal of east end folk their way of life the buffers came off when 1 they extended it from two nights a week 2 the slater family turned up how they attract viewers is beyond me the kat character symbolizes everything that s gone wrong with society treating anyone else like something she s pulled off the bottom of her shoe the people who vote her the best character in these polls must the same as the ones that vote jamie redknapp best sportsman despite the fact he hasn t played a game for 3 years what i can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of british tv why do all the biggest names leave ross kemp martin kemp the list is endless how long has the longest couple s marriage lasted with them being faithful to each other yes people leave but until the script writers realise that characters couple can be interesting likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate an episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that and zoe the doctor top even lofty shell as most unconvincing couple ever to appear on tv yes eastenders is the most watched show thats undisputed but many external factors contribute to that 19 30 20 00 is the perfect time of day to gain the most audience figures it has an omnibus edition for 2 hours and more than that millions of the viewers watch it out of nothing more than habit but if they were completely honest to themselves they would admit that in 2002 more than ever it can be absolutely pitiful 
278,where was his critique of democratic administrations as well as republican ones after all he did serve for 17 years in a body of government where his influence was unwaivering oh i forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most powerful nation on earth the film is happy to show shots of a young senator gore asking why a nasa scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper but fails to ask about the complicity of clinton gore in global warming probably too close to an election year or maybe it would hurt the chances for hillary in 08 either way he s a political coward and party man to the bitter end he offers no criticism of consumerism no criticism of capitalism no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time in the end this film was much more about mr gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces mr gore if you really wanted to make a campaign film shorten it call it what it really is 
757,some of the reviewers of this film were extremely generous with praise i personally was disappointed because due to those reviews i was optimistic as the opening credits began to roll the all too familiar story line goes like this deformed boy and his father live out in louisiana swamp local boys ridicule and torment him local boys start gruesome s oh sorry i mean victor crowley s cabin on fire with him in it dad attempts to rescue his son formerly known as eddie munster meets the elephant man but accidentally puts a hatchet through the kid s head instead victor becomes a murderous ghost who hunts down unfortunates who enter his domain oooo scary one thing i appreciated about hatchet was that it never took itself seriously and some of the gags even made me laugh the thing is i ve grown tired of the hollywood polished b horror slap sticks i like to laugh and i enjoy a good scare but this film didn t deliver a solid dose of either as for crowley being the next michael jason or freddy pumpkinhead has a better chance 
586,i absolutely loved this movie as a child i can t seem to find it anywhere i was mentioning it to some friends just the other day and not a single one of them remembers it can anyone help me out my older sister vaguely remembers it there was also another movie i remember that was half live action and half animation but i can t remember the name of it the characters were animated and the background was real i seem to remember it being about a kangaroo and i believe the setting of the film was in australia i m going out of my mind trying to obtain copies of these films that were such a memorable part of my very enjoyable childhood edit i searched imdb for this other movie and found out it s called dot and the kangaroo all i had to do was type in kangaroo in the search bar under characters and the name of the movie in the list was like a bell going off man i love imdb thanks 
453,mature intelligent and highly charged melodrama unbelivebly filmed in china in 1948 wei wei s stunning performance as the catylast in a love triangle is simply stunning if you have the oppurunity to see this magnificent film take it
913,greetings from lithuania this is the first question that comes to head after watching this movie you know i saw a lot of bad movies in my life but after watching this one i only had two questions 1 is this was just a parody spoof 2 how could people create such a thing if you never saw this film than you really don t know what is a really bad film i mean bad the script are you kidding my acting is so horrible that i thing the actors where just having fun in this movie i know this is b movie but come on is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage oh and what an ending a must miss ending just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw wait until the ending because that kind of ending you have never saw before and i hope you will never see awoid this movie at any cost and don t say i didn t warn you 
376,it was once suggested by pauline kael never a fan that cassavetes thought not like a director but like an actor what kael meant was his supposed lack of sophistication as a filmmaker to take that comparison further to me it never feels like cassavetes is directing himself in a film it feels like cassavetes implanting himself inside his own creation like orson welles cassavetes is just as much of a genius as welles but far more important as a true artist as opposed to a technician or rhetorician this is like a cross between italian passion though cassavetes was actually greek and scandinavian introversion never before have inner demons been so exposed physically it s about the mystery of becoming performing and acting like a haunted skip james record it s got the echoes of ghosts all around rowlands breakdowns which are stupefying and almost operatic surprising coming from cassavetes are accompanied by a jumpy unsettling piano who is this dead girl the metaphysical possibilities are endless and it s amazing to find this kind of thing in a cassavetes film just the overt display of intelligence there is also a brief bit of voice over at the beginning but then he always was intelligent he just never flapped it around for easy praise this is not adaptation here the blending of reality and fiction and drama is not to show cleverness but to show the inner turmoil and confusion it creates there s so much going on the pure joyous love when rowlands greets her doorman the horror when she beats herself up the scene where the girl talks about how she devoted her life to art and to music is one of the most effective demonstrations of understanding what it means to be a fan of someone you can see some roots of this in a star is born and almodovar borrowed from it for all about my mother i think the ending is a little bit of a disappointment because of the laughing fits but the preparation leading up to it is almost sickening you can shoot me but i think the alcoholism despite its urgency in many of the scenes is a relatively small point about the film it s a living breathing thing and it feels like a process it could go any direction at any time like taste of cherry we are reminded that you must never forget this is only a play yet it is dangerous when rowlands says that line is it great drama how will the audience take it is she being reflexive or does she just not care her character s breakdowns are incorporated into the performances and ultimately the film in such a way that it s like witnessing a female james dean 10 10
389,the sopranos 1999 2007 number 1 television show of all time everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn t go past a pilot episode the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss tony soprano accompanied by a stellar cast edie falco is superb as the worrying loving upper middle class mother tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious greying consiglieri who is often very funny while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian americans as mafiosi and to an extent this is undeniable i can see so many positives from the show the portrayal of strong family values friendships love and compassion could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters yes furthermore other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism social inequality and injustice homosexuality drugs etc this is no shallow dull show about tough guys and violence it has so much more many of the issues we see on the show are very real the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters lives which makes the whole thing more interesting credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini for envisioning television s most complex and enigmatic character simply exceptional 10 10
717,i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i ve seen in years unlike the recent trend of 90 s horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self mocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here this is the perfect blend of 80 s and 90 s horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90 s films and the stalking slasher madness of an 80 s flick i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right direction denise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie 
269,another one for the babes bullets crowd the story is much edgier than any other musical i have seen cannons hidden up the missing legs of females and places each generatively in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the locale more effective than contemporary drama it is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants in lue of leggage pretty remarkable if you consider the context despite the cannon up the leg thing providing 90 of the surprises this film also chronicles how greed supersedes all other considerations in the lives of a group of yakuzas who pursue a woman who keeps up her leg a concealed cannon rocket launcher hence no group shower scenes or thongs the hidden projectile launcher which is pulled out from the behind the protagonists back seemingly from nowhere in miike s dead or alive 1999 the torch brought forth out of thin air by the heroine towards the end of the original tomie 2000 or the harrowing flame thrower scene in sunny gets blue 1992 all testify to an almost third world cantinflas esquire influence in the contemporary japanese cinema of which i am at a loss to explain but cannot complain you won t see good quality movies of this essence made in hollywood its all but extinct and with cheap crap they pump out for a cheap thrill is all but laughable this is a true film and while its great in its entirety the ending is a brilliant if not unblatant rip off of certain sergio leon pictures involving cannons where legs should be and certainly is appropriate 
270,well i generally like iranian movies and after having seen 10 by kiarostami the night before i was expecting a great movie i was very disappointed this is by far the worst iranian film and one of the most boring asian movies i have ever seen if you have never seen a kiarostami movie before watch ten instead if you want some good iranian movies you may also try sib aka the apple this movie is divided in 5 parts and only the fourth featuring some funny ducks is worth watching if this is the first iranian movie you see you probably won t want to see any more i don t blame you but you will miss some great movies 
583,i m not saying that just as a chris rock fan i m saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong the first flaw was it s everything works out ending that everybody saw coming flaw number two was i found that the chemistry between regina king and chris rock seemed fake finally the acting in this movie was sub par with the best actor being regina king and the worst being mark addy but i saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy in a heads up scenario watch heaven can wait instead it s better so for all you chris rock fans out there watch this movie you ll enjoy out he has some good stand up in this movie overall 7 out of 10
703,while both this movie and the signature car chase have been shown a lack of respect by many critics both are way above average roy scheider does an excellent job playing his best type a tough courageous cop who works hard to get the job done in spite of the desk drivers and politicians who should be supporting him rather than hindering he played a suburbanized version of this same role as the tourist town police chief in jaws not nearly as gritty but the same get the job done despite the politicians and gutsy approach if a man who can t swim and is terrified of everything in the water going out on an old boat with an ahab wannabee and a nerd to confront a huge killer shark isn t gutsy then tell me what is tony lo bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain most of the villains in fact have some depth and complexity this is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings overall it captures the atmosphere of parts of ny city gritty unglamorous often dangerous but filled with energy the story is spare tight and subtle it gets the job done without extraneous elements it may not be one of the all time greats but it is an exceptionally good movie everyone has an opinion about car chases mine is that this one is right up there with the mustang vs dodge charger chase in bullitt the pontiac ventura chevy nova was similar to the mustang in being a compact car chassis with beefed up suspension and a powerful small block v8 stuffed into an engine bay meant for an insipid 6 the ventura novas got little respect off the drag strip but with the proper suspension mods they made affordable performance cars that could handle on both the road and the track the bawling of those gm v8 s as they wind up is music to the enthusiast s ear i ve heard this chase criticized for imitating the bullitt chase the truth is that they are two works by the same master bill hickman who also choreographed and drove for the french connection chase besides driving most of the car chase scenes he created a brooding malevolent presence and a good match with richard lynch as a pair of coldly evil killers yes the chase has realism errors often noted like the use of 3 different ny roads to represent the palisades parkway the ending of the chase in a crash with an 18 wheeler on a roadway for passenger vehicles only and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape harm that s beside the point let s face it movie car chases are unreal by nature in bullitt the french connection and the seven ups however bill hickman and phillip d antoni crafted chases far more realistic and therefore more exciting than the flying rolling exploding vehicle fantasy chases so common in recent films 
497,the railway children at least this 1970 movie version written and directed by that long time british character actor lionel jeffries is an unmitigated classic it tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm the sentimentality is muted the evocation of childhood adventures is involving and jeffries brings cleverness and style to his production the waterbury family is leading an idyllic life in edwardian london the father is prosperous the mother is beautiful and loving the children are well mannered and affectionate their home is warm and cozy then one night during the christmas holidays two men appear at the doorstep talk quietly to the father and then take him away in a moment the lives of mrs waterbury dinah sheridan and bobbie 14 jenny agutter phyllis 12 sally thomsett and young peter gary warren have been changed only their fortitude and good spirits are going to see them through now teetering into poverty mrs waterbury takes her children to live in a musty old brick house in the countryside near a rail line not too far from a small village with a train station the children discover the rail and regularly sit on a small hill to wave at the passengers as the train chugs by one day an old gentleman going to his business in the city looks up from his newspaper and finds himself waving back it s not long before he will play an important part in the story as time passes mrs waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to bear on her children she begins to write stories to earn money she teaches them their lessons and provides a home of warmth and security for them the story however is about these three children especially bobbie at 14 she is old enough to want to share her mother s worries yet young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother they find a poor man at the station who cannot speak english they discover he is a russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are they insist he must come home with them and their mother takes him in before long the children have written a large sign to the old gentlemen on the train asking for his help they help a young man taking part in a steeplechase who breaks his leg in a train tunnel soon he is at their home recuperating they decide to have a birthday party for the station master a man with few friends and several children who is a stickler for his dignity it s not long before the children help him realize the difference between friendship and charity in other words the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures and manage to be instrumental in seeing that all the problems have happy endings but what of their own problems bobbie finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away because he had been accused of treason of giving state secrets to the russians will bobbie be able to find a way to help will the old gentleman be something more than simply an old gentleman on a passing train will their father s case be reopened will there be a happy ending jenny agutter was almost 18 when she filmed her part she plays the 14 year old bobbie with great naturalness and charm as important as the other players are especially dinah sheridan as the mother agutter is the heart of the story for me it is jenny agutter s talent and lionel jeffries style and restraint that make this movie so memorable the story s problems come with no serious doubt but that they will be solved and jeffries does not just give us an expertly adapted and directed movie he adds touches that are barely noticed but which charm us this might include just a split second of a freeze frame as two people talk or a slow close up of a small yellow wildflower in the grass outside bobbie s home then a slow pull back from a yellow oil lamp being turned up inside or the realization that a delightful interior shot or a view of the green countryside or a look at the train station from a hill all suddenly recall those charming edwardian hand tinted drawings of a perfect by gone time perhaps this gentle story can t compete for the time kids need nowadays to perfect their nintendo monster splatting skills i m almost positive it would never capture the attention of most of their parents especially those weaned on batman and leone still it s a perfectly put together movie and shouldn t be forgotten as an aside 19 years later the story was retold as a television program this time jenny agutter played the mother 
166,i should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art because they are human beings and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature that said the simplistic notion that ingmar bergman s great 1968 film shame or skammen is merely an anti war film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film compared to its more filmically showoffy predecessors persona and hour of the wolf shame is seemingly a more classic film in terms of narrative but the key word is seemingly for while it lacks the bravura pop psychologizing of persona and the gaudy horror film homages of hour of the wolf it is one of the best films ever made about war and not as an anti war film nor a pro war film as such it has to rank with wild strawberries as one of his greatest films as well as one of his best screenplays if not the best although ostensibly a more psychologically exterior film than the films that preceded it it truly says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive in it max von sydow and liv ullman play jan and eva rosenberg perhaps a nod at the infamous american spies whom many european intellectuals felt were innocent two musicians who used to play for the local philharmonic orchestra before a war broke out and they retreated to live on a small plot of land on an island content to working in a greenhouse the country they live in is unnamed as is the island they live on although the film was made on bergman s small island of farö just off the northern end of the swedish island of göttland it seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another province this is all left deliberately hazy as this war is meant to symbolize all wars this is reinforced as the film starts with assorted war quotes on the screen as the credits roll these include quotes from hitler to vietnam era american military figures after early scenes that depict the prosaic nature of their rural life and then the coming of war where even old men are conscripted an aerial attack ravages the rosenbergs land as enemy jets fly overhead dropping bombs and what seems to be chemical weapons of an agent orange like nature one plane is hit and a parachutist jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree jan who starts off the film as a sniveling coward refuses to go and help so eva goes alone jan joins her and they find the pilot has been shot it seems he is indeed part of the invading or possibly rebel force a bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot then advise the couple to leave their home as the invaders are near there are the misinterpretations of the film on a micro level such as that of bergman scholar marc gervais who provides the film commentary on the dvd of the film like many other critics he claims that jacobi is a quisling who has collaborated with the invaders but this is clearly and demonstrably wrong for jacobi is with the original fascist government as proof first off the invaders are repelled after they invade the rosenbergs land and shoot their agitprop interview we know this because the government that later questions them of the faked interview and words put into eva s mouth see the film as supposed proof of their treason and jacobi is clearly working with them the fascist big brother statists secondly jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the townsfolk are sent to concentration camps for collaborating with the invaders and the rosenbergs again are among those spared thirdly in his seduction of eva jacobi tells her his son is on leave from the military and clearly if he was an invader he would not be speaking so happily of his son serving the state also rebel forces are not official armies and do not grant official leave lastly filip is clearly with the rebels or invaders of the organization and why would he have killed a colleague that gervais and other critics so blatantly and wantonly misinterpret and flat out miss such a key and manifest point of this film brings into question their ability to discern any and all aspects of all of bergman s films this is a wonderful and great film and very high in the berman canon but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers have really understand its complex message instead opting out for the cheap lazy and easy claim of its being merely anti war and a rather simple film in comparison to its two showier predecessors and that in the long run is the real shame of shame 
574,this movie is so bad i knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person very bad acting very bad plot very bad moviedo yourself a favour and don t watch it 1 10
184,this sleek sexy movie is a must see only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film personally i enjoy the narrator for his intelligent no subject left untouched style of narration the introduction grips you right away and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film he provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really connect with internal horror this film exhibits the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully not only for kids but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography it surely defines the word masterpiece 
485,i don t understand the exaggerated good critics about this film except that a lot of people from venezuela are understandably very excited based on that the venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind of what other countries are in the region the movie first of all is too repetitive a lot of scenes are almost identical from each of the both leading roles so you get the impression that it s a time filler a time filler is also a good point as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes you will start to get tired after a while and watch on the clock all actors are quite bad by exception of the venezuelan guy edgar ramirez who brings in a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the venezuelan recruit pedro by the way this is not a representative movie about the people of the region caribean zone it tends to ridicules them 
681,this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business the idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot i rented the film is discouraging also obsessed teacher 3 years prior kills teenager s family because he wants her for no reason he kills the mother father and brother from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison hmm usual bad writing no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around sniff out people and with a knife is super killer sure now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason knifes bellhop for the fun of it and starts to hunt down the teenager s friends now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel again it is stupid ever cop would know his face but he walks right by them now he kills two cops outside teenager s house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage if any other profession put out work of this low quality they would be fired yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash 
233,now i like victor herbert and i like mary martin and allan jones but it would have been nice to see a real biography of victor herbert walter connolly as herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter yearsjones and martin sing beautifully though the herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers jones s john ramsay is a frail character very similar to gaylord ravenal in showboat who jones also played as for mary martin it s a mystery why she never had a good hollywood career she did films with bing crosby and dick powell as well as this one she performed well but movie audiences didn t take to her the best musical moment in the film is jones and martin in a duet of thine alone the recordings i have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet there s also a pleasant scene with jones and martin riding bicycles swapping herbert songs as they ride the real victor herbert with his womanizing and his irish patriot background and his musical training in germany where he developed a love for all things german would have been a fascinating study he was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing i have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said cuddles sakall would have been a good victor herbert sakall as irish hello nice movie but the real vic would have been so much better 
651,i only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie no it was a hundred times worse ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that s not true the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever the american cop has a german accent the police station was a desk in a warehouse with a sign police station hanging on the wall there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet this cop pulls women over cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse he tells his cop partner to wait in the car then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women but he isn t sure if that is what s happening because he s a moron the dialog is totally stupid the acting is awful and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen it is totally obvious to the cop s partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it and yet the partner who is there all along doesn t know what is happening the director of this film is a total hack i stopped the movie at 30 minutes because i couldn t take it anymore it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won t waste anymore time on it writing this review absolutely worthless 
444,i made it about 8 minutes into steel frontier before i turned it off then glutton for punishment that i am i watched some more the next day today i had to iron a pile of clothes so i decided to finish the movie and that was its own punishment here s what i don t understand robert rodriguez and shane carruth each spent 7 000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money and they churn out a huge steaming pile of crap let me see if i can figure out the logic it s road warrior but it s like a future western we ll get the cheapest actors we can find we ll have my mentally challenged cousin write the script and we ll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions we can t lose seriously i don t think even the mst3k guys could improve this but if you insist on watching it i recommend getting very drunk first 
420,this is a very beautiful and almost meditative film there is hardly any dialogue in it apart from the narration and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly i didn t at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend who also has red hair it is almost an old fashioned type of children s films saying that children nowadays prefer animations like shrek or toy story etc but i feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages not just children 
498,if you like sci fi monsters and ancient legends then you will love this movie the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago while the acting may have been a little less than desirable the story line and effects adequately compensated for it i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen tv if you like non stop action awesome visuals and taste for myth and lore you have to see this movie 
256,well the story is a little hard to follow the first time but that s only because of all the bare breasted 70s painted up vampire witches dancing to the bongo drums this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them and for girl on girl action vampiric or not this movie just rocks 
464,it s a cooking competition show americanized it s not going to be the japanese version the show is great i could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch from the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman truly a good way to spend some time watching tv you could critique the show for having guests like marc ecko as a judge but meh it s entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize oh yeah and i m bitter john besh isn t the new iron chef ala cuisine 
194,anyone who has seen the piece of steaming smelly poo called congo understands my title and i feel for you this movie wasn t just bad it was painful the book was stupid the script was even dumber and the cast was terrible dylan walsh rumor has it julia roberts dumped your ass cause this movie blew so bad huge diamonds killer gorillas talking gorillas hmmm sounds like a hit oh tim curry s accent is so bad in this movie i would prefer being deaf i recommend this movie to bulimics looking to purge after a heavy meal or kavorkian patients who just need that one more reason to die if this is faithful to the book i would say lets have us a good old fashion footloose book burning and destroy every copy if future generations look back and find this garbage how would we explain ourselves listen to the others who hated this movie don t watch it run away do not watch this movie if you think it is full of action or suspense or cool effects you are wrong if you think it blows more cock than nicole ritchie you d be right so if you still are going to watch crapo i mean congo i say do it after you just took 50 tylenol pm 
637,great premise poor execution cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written poorly directed poorly edited waste of film only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food joan chen mercedes ruehl kyra sedgwick and alfre woodard should fire their agents 
851,i really have to disagree with guy yardley rees who should he have watched the entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery some of the best ever shot in skye and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole this is not a big budget film rather it is a film that has a strong community feel i can t say how much standard films bore me pushing out the same polished stuff again and again seachd doesn t seem to be about that at all it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film ok so the acting isn t in the style a blockbuster that s because the actors are seemingly real people i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing and at times unusually beautiful seachd really bears a second viewing since there are many threads that become clearer second time around that really do feed into the ending overall the combination of music and at times stunning visuals plus a community approach to the acting and non normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film more of these please 
117,there s no romance or other side plot to this movie it s action and intrigue all the way making it a real man s kung fu movie an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who s styles represents five venomous animals centipede snake scorpion lizard and the toad despite the word venom in the title none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents yan tieh told by his teacher that he s no match for the five former pupil must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story with good kung fu action spread out throughout the story recognized as a cult classic this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung fu action movies it s known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story it s no artistic masterpiece with the usual bad dubbing and corny acting but the movie is one of the best of its kind because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung fu action movie of its time and gives an extra concentrated dose of them one movie you must watch if you are a kung fu movie fan 
271,you can survive surviving christmas i thought the television version was a bit edited way down i like ben afleck he plays drew johnson a family less adult who is willing to pay complete strangers the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco the daughter drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn t have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars bill macy who i best remember for playing maude s husband arthur is hired to play duda the grandfather when the whole situation comes crashing down the truth can be painful the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation drew s rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit you can t buy what you wish for the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene 
368,chokher bali a passion play based on rabindranath tagore s novel of the same name this is a classic tale of deception adultery and relationship exploitation set in 1900 bengal director rituparno ghosh transformed the nobel laureates acclaimed literature into a delightful visual treat tagore s story elaborately deals with the bengali society through his central character the rebellious widow who wants to live a life of her own we are taken into the picturesque part of bengal where we meet our heroine the beautiful young widow binodini aishwarya rai despite her gorgeous looks two handsome men the rich mahindra prosenjit chatterji and his friend behari toto roychowdhury denied marrying her mahindra chooses a naive ashalata raima sen over binodini and marries her leaving behind the country life the free spirited binodini accompanies mahindra s mother to calcutta as a caretaker soon her friendship with ashalata flourishes it looks like the two addressing each other as chokher bali sand in the eyes share an enduring bond the english speaking binodini captures a special place in the house but soon she unmasks her real face manipulating good natured ashlata binodini gets closer with mahindra and fulfills her sexual desires when she is thrown out by the enraged mother of mahindra binodini seeks solace from a reluctant behari the remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters crisscross and culminate in an unimaginable climax aishwarya walks through the role a manipulative rebellious lady still gaining the viewer s sympathy with a ballet dancer s elegance the other lead artistes prosenjit chatterjee raima sen and toto roychowdhury are equally brilliant in enacting their characters while tagore penned this mould breaking story at the turn of the 20th century the very idea of widow marriage was a taboo even among the upper class narrating the nations freedom movement in parallel the author asserts the importance of individual freedom from the caged life kudos to the art director who gave life to the early 20th century bengal and applause to the cinematographer for capturing those sets with verve this passion play by tagore has been fervently converted to the screen by the ablest filmmaker without loosing its originality 
648,my eyes in the name of god and all that is holy make me unsee this movie what drugs are you people on this could very well be the worst movie ever i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time i need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster from start to finish glow ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema when i thought to watch this movie with my jewish best friend and his family we thought oh hey this may be funny it will probably be bad but still a little funny how wrong we were we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be all of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the film was over and during the course of the movie one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon i wish i had watched the video from the ring instead that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days for all who wish to see this movie you are not prepared you may think you are some sort of tough guy by renting this but this movie will break you push you to the ground and urinate on you 
959,this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original cartoon there s this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are it s atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn t bother me so much so that i didn t even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all it s miserably forgettable the only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja 
300,i admit that i am a vampire addict i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten i was very impressed by the original john carpenter s vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first and it is not quite so dark but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else 
369,i m not sure how i can make ten lines out of this question but i ll try when julie went to the dance and they were dancing to slow music what was the name of the song that was playing and who played it i love that song and i watch the movie over and over just to hear that one song i did several searches online and even looked up the soundtrack but i sill can t find the song it might be because the song they were dancing to wasn t a complete song and just partial i would appreciate if anyone out there who knows what the name of the song and the group who sung it thank you frank
815,bobby and mikey are two little boys who move across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life soon after the family settles in their mom marries the king who ends up being an abusive stepfather especially to bobby so bobby decides that he will fly away from the abuse in his birthday present this movie was difficult to watch especially the abuse scenes it was hard to watch an innocent playful little boy become abused and turn into a sullen scared and withdrawn young man the acting is excellent i cried throughout the last half of the movie there were some funny scenes in it too like the monster brew and the dog that finds the pop bottles i wouldn t suggest letting little kids watch it it was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really really flew away 
677,the first home alone was a decent enough film the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting this one tries to be original and succeeds to some degree of course the formula is basically the same so it s like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot the new score is quite bad though the new setting traps piece was if nothing else interesting and different especially compared to the grand score of the first and the almost but not quite as good score of the second it almost makes up for it by using some pretty good non original music but it s just not the same the plot is fair and somewhat original to the franchise but it s still basically the same movie as the first two with worse acting and a less impressive example of the scary character turning out to be good the acting is mostly unimpressive the characters are mostly caricatures the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones and they make fun of spy stuff which is almost criminal given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are and how precious few of them are cool the fact that there are more of them and thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films and it doesn t work the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too adult and serious for a children s film and there was a sexual joke or two though that isn t the first time in the series it s also unnecessarily complex as is the plot in general i could follow it but i doubt a kid could some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid the animal stuff is generally not amusing there are fewer siblings which should mean that those there are get developed more but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films all in all just not particularly good or worth watching unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon y violence i recommend this to huge fans of the series only 3 10
225,a throwback to the old fashioned westerns of the 30s and 40s such as dodge city dallas has a number of things going for it gary cooper at his coolest blazing technicolor photography by ernest haller gone with the wind and a pulse pounding max steiner king kong gwtw dodge city et al score in addition there is a masquerade mistaken identity a faked death and more hair breath escapes than a republic serial as always cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure forget the 50s angst western this is pure entertainment 
179,a hard to find film which coasts on the still pervasive mythology of senator joe mccarthy as a political demon king boyle as joe gives a compelling but historically inaccurate portrayal of the wisconsin senator the caricature mccarthy many take as the real one meredith as wily army lawyer joseph welch who outsmarted mccarthy at the army hearings in 1954 is very good as always in fact mccarthy and cohn were quite right in worrying about the appalling security situation in the army and the 1954 army hearings became enmeshed in the smokescreen used by the army to deflect the investigation away from their security failings which the committee were investigating by counter charging that mccarthy and cohn were trying to get favours for their staffer david schine whilst in the service the film is self satisfied agenda driven polemic based in the pervasive myths which have passed for the truth with many people for decades that the red scare was essentially phony and mccarthy huac etc were always blasting away at the wrong targets being no more than lying career ruining publicity hounds who were trampling over the constitutional rights of startled innocent liberals who were accused of being security risks communists people who know little about the matter still feel confident in repeating misinformation on mccarthy and the red scare to this day clooney s murrow hagiography is an example the misinformation is pervasive no wonder people have swallowed it a recent obit of budd schulberg in the serious left wing uk newspaper the guardian headlined that the hollywood writer named names to mccarthy perpetuating the lie that mccarthy investigated hollywood as head of huac the truth being that mccarthy was never even a member of huac and he had little interest in the politics of hollywood types his investigations were confined almost exclusively to arms of the us government the mythology about the red scare being baseless is now completely exploded by recently opened soviet and us government documents if anything mccarthy and co underestimated the sheer scale of soviet and fellow traveller infiltration in the us but decades of public misinformation about this period will be hard to correct one day maybe some really brave hollywood soul will make a movie telling the truth about how many american men and women clandestinely aided the mass murderer stalin and worked to impose his vicious system of government on the western world giving an accurate account maybe of joe mccarthy s career but i won t hold my breath till then we have this mythical drunken lying scoundrel of popular imagination so familiar in the media tail gunner joe 
670,this show is awful how is george wanting the death of his mother funny this show is terrible the parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat george isn t funny especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of spanglish ernie is a loser but at least i ve chuckled at him a few times but mainly at how pathetic he is george s mother benny in an awful despicable character sure her husband left her but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated george as a baby is beyond me can someone explain to me how george s head being big is funny it s not even that big i ve moved on from characters because they re too awful and it would take hours for me to write and i frankly don t care enough i do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom and is not worth your time i give it 2 starts because the wife is extremely attractive 
30,very interesting to find another reviewer who had the exact same reaction to this movie as i did it was a heck of a lot better when i was 10 or 11 years old seeing it more than 30 years later it s still okay but it only mildly held my interest what seemed hugely funny back then was only mildly amusing also things that were astonishing to me as a 10 year old came across as just silly for example in one scene trinity is walking along and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking in fact he doesn t even bother to look and see if they re dead because he knows he hit the mark um yeah right in addition a lot of the dialogue sounds quite wooden sorry but 35 years later it hasn t really aged that well although it s been a long time since i ve seen that one as well probably a better terrence hill film than this one would be my name is nobody 
691,shocking in 1965 i saw jury gagarin alive he was sincere unpretentious and kindly he was at ease and looked like well educated and intellectual person in this movie i saw a clown the actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry they made a cartoon the real gagarin was someone else don t believe in this movie i saw this movie after the movies like taming of fire and apollo 13 and after reading books rockets and people by chertok and korolev myths and facts by golovanov i was shocked by tiresome scenario poor acting and producing and a lots of inexactitudes of space race the movie is the tedious rendering of well known in russia historical facts a lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated some facts and details were perverted for example in 1945 korolev was already not a prisoner liberated in 1944 and in 1940 he was already not in kolyma prison gold mine but in special prison design bureau korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners but in the movie korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform imho the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can t to make interesting movies 
739,this was a crappy movie with a whole lotta non sense and too many loose ends to count i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ron livingston made a cameo in it and i continued watching it because as a girl i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change later i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get and each time it got more ridiculous sean crawley good looking chris l mckenna whom i ve never seen before but loved his little nude scene is making ends meet as a painter when he meets electrician duke wayne george wendt from cheers thinking he s getting more work from duke sean agrees to meet contractor ray matthews daniel baldwin playing a stereotypically evil guy ray is being investigated by a city hall accountant ron livingston in a cameo who i ve been in love with from office space up to sex the city ray end up offering the apparently desperate for cash sean 13k to kill the accountant and sean accepts the job sean stalks out the accountant whose wife kari wuhrer he finds himself attracted to completes the hit and leaves taking the file of information against ray with him sean quickly learns he was being used that ray never intended to pay him and sean uses the file as leverage to get his money up to this point it s a descent flick generally worth watching but as soon as ray duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him it just got dumber and dumber and still dumber until finally it seemed like the film s writer charlie higson had snapped out of a 10 day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something without simply detailing the movie let s just say that in every single scene you watch after the kidnapping you find yourself gasping what the f k baffled by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption in the end so many loose ends are left in the movie that you begin to regret that you even watched it this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it s full value it s supposed to be a psychological thriller and mckenna is a decent actor but it s hard to give yourself to the movie when you have norm from cheers and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense guys will love the violence blood and guts scenes and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots girls will enjoy handsome sean s gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie personally i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ron livingston is only in the first one third of the movie 
988,i love kristen dunst especially in elizabethtown i guess she s the kind of actress who had better not act before camera but just be herself she did that and she looked so natural in elizabethtown in this movie however she did try to add in more artificial performance especially in the first half of the film so that she looked more like a sober editor while in the other half she totally set herself back in her daily track and i just couldn t tell her to be an editor any way therefore her performance is not enduring in this film the film on the whole is attracting and inspiring the character of young is full and reasonable anyway the film tells a big and sophisticated story the only big defect is that it didn t show a turning point of the hero and heroine s love story i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story because that is rather unclear for the two persons 
164,i once promised never to walk out of any film a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck such as rambo 3 baise moi deep impact but mr seidl almost succeeded hundstage was a truly awful experience anyone who sees this movie will think that austrians are a miserable pathetic bunch of retards it shows a world where love and humanity don t exist a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason to distract from their own miserable existence by choosing a documentary like style with non professional actors most of them look like straight from the imagination of austrian shock cartoonist deix director seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in austrian european western suburbs the viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies violence against women and handicapped people madness and degradation but this isn t social criticism this is just pure shock without any aesthetic value instead you get bad acting bad cinematography bad filmmaking if anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes this is pseudo social criticism with a sledge hammer and it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way it shows ugly people that is not the reason why i hate it but it depicts average people in an ugly misanthropic way and this is why this film is truly despicable 
356,i have seen all the film interpretations of hamlet from sir lawrence olivier to mel gibson gasp derek jacobi captures the true essence of the character from the beginning to the brutal climax superb acting all around this one should not be missed 
346,although i was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school 1996 when i saw it i became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them their hair clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar i remember thinking how real it was and how i wished that they would make movies like that still in fact i saw this movie the night after i had been at a crazy party not so unlike the one in jay s house which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd a world class bs er and responsible mother figure type i identified immediately with jeanie i was also the one with a car although i had a little bit of madge s insecurities floating around in there too my best friend was a deidre and her good friend from childhood was our annie watching the scene when jeanie is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations i had personally had now at the age of 27 i recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth though none of my friends died i think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up 
135, red sonja is flawed weak and lacking even the camp ness isn t good there are only two good things about red sonja the costumes even though the red sonja costume is ridiculous it s ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men because she was raped still choose to wear so few little clothes even when it rains and the music by ennio morricone still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable the story is extremely simple and they didn t even bother to make it interesting the story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways the movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely brigitte nielsen is an horrible leading lady i don t know who s accent is worse hers or arnie s and on top of that she can t act there is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable even worse was sandahl bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag ronald lacey was somewhat good in his role but my god he looked horrible he changed so much since his only well known role in raiders of the lost ark maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991 and by the way what was with all those raiders of the lost ark actors in this movie next to ronald lacey pat roach terry richards and tutte lemkow appeared in a role it seemed like some kind of raiders of the lost ark reunion the only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the sword fights even though some of them are needless and weak only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy genre 4 10
457,i just saw this movie tonight opening night it was great i m a big fan of sports movies and this was right up there as one of my favorites dennis quaid was great oh by the way mr quaid if you read this my sister lives in austin where you live and she was supposed to buy you a drink once well she kinda stood you up but she didn t mean to c not that anyone s going to believe that anyway it s a great movie everyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see it c 
3,this movie is likely the worst movie i ve ever seen in my life surpassing the previous most god awful movie spawn of slithis which i saw when i was about 10 bad acting stilted and ridiculous dialog incomprehensible plot mishmashed cut scenes even the music was annoying did i leave anything out well the special effects weren t bad but cgi does not a decent movie make i can t believe i actually spent money to see this movie if anyone has the contact info for hyung rae shim the director please forward it to my user name at gmail and i ll contact him to personally demand a refund 
622,if you watched the series and love the league as i do then prepare to be disappointed i went to the cinema with a group of die hard league fans and we were all in agreement that this film wasn t as funny or dark as the three series before in my personal opinion it was a money spinner the writing was contrived and the plot confused no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do it was self indulgence of the worst kind from writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticisms i hope the league at least can be honest enough with themselves and acknowledge this film as being inferior to the superb three series i will not be buying it despite owning most of the league memorabilia 
168,time does extraordinary things it s the ultimate judge time has granted married to the mob an extra doses of freshness there aren t any dead moments or cheap shots it s more of a delight now than it ever was michelle pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that it s as far away from a caricature as anything she s ever done a true original creation touching or hinting at the stereotype just to guide us through but her angela is quite unique the legendary dean stockwell presents us with a a mafia boss that it s just as menacingly real as he is hilarious and matthew modine why did i think back then that he didn t have any chemistry with pfeiffer i was wrong they are wonderful together they reminded me this time to the barbara stanwyck fred macmurray of remember the night i m writing this comment now to entice you to visit or revisit this jonathan demme gem 
122, crossfire is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that s a murder mystery with a strong message it stars robert young robert mitchum robert ryan sam levene and gloria grahame and is strongly directed by edward dmytryk we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning and for the rest of the film young as the detective finlay in charge of the case seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death and just as important why the victim joseph samuels sam levene is someone the soldiers meet in a bar they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and samuels winds up dead i don t know about 1947 but seeing crossfire today one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects i don t suppose it was so apparent back then as these actors were just getting started nevertheless the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting good direction violence and unsparing anti semite language the characterizations are vivid including that of gloria grahame in a smallish role she s a woman who meets mitchell george cooper one of the suspect soldiers in a bar and can provide him with an alibi the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan but everyone is excellent robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife truly excellent and a must see 
89,i ll dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies they are too numerous to name a much shorter list would be what they got right 1 dude named noah 2 ark with animals on it if you want a much more accurate portrayal of noah s ark and the destruction of sodom go rent the bible 1966 it depicts the story of creation through abraham attempting to sacrifice his son isaac it s a much better movie and it may be that the abomination called noah s ark 1999 drove you to seek just such a film http www imdb com title tt0060164 i really couldn t stomach watching the whole movie from reading other comments i can see that even the atheists found it grossly inaccurate as a christian it was intolerable to me possibly the worst movie ever made no real point to this movie either except maybe to showcase their sub par computer animation was it a complete waste maybe not god can use evil to work good romans 8 28 says 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose genesis 50 says 20 but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive in the second example joseph s brothers meant to kill him but god turned their evil into a very great good he may have done the same thing with this movie people were so astonished by its lack of biblical foundation that they probably broke out the dusty old bible and read the story for themselves to find out about lot and sodom they would have to go the whole way up to genesis 19 before god destroys sodom and gomorrah by then they have read almost half of genesis so they might want to finish the next book is exodus which the movie the ten commandments was based on and much more accurately if they have seen that movie then exodus becomes an easy read so now they have read at least two whole books of the bible just because they watched a pathetic movie about noah s ark i m sure this actually happened to someone out there god works in mysterious ways 
518,i haven t seen it in over twenty years oj was the bus driver arte johnson was the tour guide lorenzo was the kidnapper yea lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain a natural i think i watched it back then most for oj who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing but also to see arte johnson i was a little bored that johnson was so serious and yes it shifted plots in reading other posts i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue i was going a stamp if it came on as a late movie i would probably record it to check it out again but i wouldn t be nostalgic over it not yet anyway there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out 
145,despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes this entry the fourth feels tired toshiharu ikeda who directed the superb mermaid legend and the seminal japanese splatter film evil dead trap shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise a miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot predictable stalking harassing assault and rape ensues the staple of roman porno is sex and sex mixed with violence both potentially exciting subjects to be sure but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh a masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening via condom is too little kink to late the series rain motif continues and the film s final scene brings relief 
841,i like both this version of dorian gray and the mgm version both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have an association with dorian this is not in the original book and that is my only complaint i especially like angela lansbury as sybil vane and george sanders as harry in the mgm version but shane briant as dorian in the tv version is much better looking i think and far more ruthless than hurd hatfield in the mgm version i think briant is more true to the novel s dorian in the end this is a very good adaptation of the novel it even hints at dorian s liaison s with men as does wylde which could not be done in the mgm version 
656,this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast and many memorable scenes the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents the spanish characters in the film are played by a frenchman boyer a belgian francen a greek paxinou and a hungarian lorre and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat despite these absurdities the performances are all very good especially those of paxinou and lorre but the scene in which boyer paxinou and lorre meet and talk in wildly different accents is a real hoot and i guess seeing as how they were alone that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway it seems pretty weird that the brothers warner couldn t find any spanish speaking actors in los angeles of course hollywood has often had an any old accent will do policy my other favorite is greta garbo swedish as mata hari dutch who falls in love with a russian soldier played by a mexican ramon novarro maybe they should have got novarro for confidential agent he would have been great in boyer s role or at least in francen s which would have saved greatly on the dark make up budget 
547,i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn t make it to the end credits first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting lame sfx and extremely poor direction pales in comparison to the original anyone ever hear about the old et atari 2600 fiasco for those who haven t let me fill you in it s 1982 et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time atari decides to release a movie tie in game on their 2600 home console system to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari 2600 et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn t even give them away let alone sell them what does universal soldier the return have to do with this story look at the 3 2 rating and figure it out for yourself awful film imdb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems doesn t go as low as 0 let alone into the negatives 
500,if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot or corny acting then backdraft is definitely the one however if like me you like watching films that you can believe then backdraft has some serious flaws it doesn t offer anything new and there are hundreds of 90 s action films that follow identical formulas whilst not being quite as clunky after two firefights i m thinking this has got to go somewhere else i mean how many big fires are there in one city surely firemen do other things such as getting cats out of trees well i was wrong and the repetition continues again and again up until the end a good aspect of the film is the fire itself well filmed and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste 
840,this is based on michael s life from 1983 4 till 2004 flex alexander did a good performance but looked nothing like michael i feel michael was portrayed as a stupid person which i don t believe he was even though he trusted the wrong people at times i thought flex alexander looked chinese when they made michael look white i think latoya should of been portrayed in this she was always pictured with her brother in the 80 s i never thought any of the supporting cast looked like their counterparts there were some things that were inaccurate lisa marie presley s son looked about 4 in the wedding scene even though he was not yet 2 when lisa and michael got married also when michael says to his mother katherine he thinks he and debbie should marry if she is carrying his child it was katherine s idea for the two to get married 
870,this movie is somehow showing 6 2 stars it seems inconceivable that the director has that many relations i am at a loss to explain this avoid this movie at all costs you have only a certain number of hours on the earth don t waste 1 1 2 of them on this retarded steaming heap of guano there is no story as apparently the director wrote and i m guessing with a blunt orange crayon the next day s script at the completion of the day s shooting the story has been called whimsical no it is aimless there is maybe enough story to fill a commercial don t you hate ads now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here and similarly the writer director can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work toy love so to recap even if you get this movie for free even if you re paid to watch it avoid it to paraphrase monty python s search for the holy grail run flee 
658,this movie was flippin awful i wanted those hours of my life back for god s sake stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs its not worth mentioning the title but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this and where do i begin the dumb a kids in the movie the zero plot or story the garden variety college frat boy esquire scenes of towel slapping or the very bad acted teen angst innuendo my god it never ended i remember thinking i would have rather kissed the movie theater floor then sit through this one again but what do you expect most people with the brain power to look up reviews are not going to be the target audience here at all so go see pirites 2 again or the jet lee one if your debating to yourself look this movie will just cost you your soul your money your energy and your brain cells heed the warning 
577,joe buck jon voight decides he s going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tutti fruttis wide eyed he comes to new york city not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other in the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffmann a homeless looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building there isn t much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe buck s plights in the city but also inter cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie jennifer salt who was gang raped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery everybody s talking we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city the odds are high he won t and will end up working for pennies in a dead end job shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this a dark story of dashed hopes john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s and at the center the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers ratso s reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed older wiser 
462,this film was both entertaining and thought provoking i d recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged great acting directing and it is canadian to boot it is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers the locations in ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era with so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick for any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle be it financial or illness this film strikes a resounding chord it approaches the idea of the afterlife in a contemporary way without cheaply capitalizing on all the gohst and supernatural themes that have become staples in hollywood and the tv networks 
713,i think it is a brilliant show with cool talking heads and very cool action 2 guys who pretend to be masters in women seduction demonstrate their skills at different night clubs and 4 experts pickup artists themselves comment on them choosing the winner their jokes are amusing and some participators are really fun to watch more so this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women lots of expert s comments are useful while you may see how it works in the field actually i think this is one of the best tv shows and i totally recommend this to all men who like women ps pardon for my broken engrish 
964, and if you re very very good it will resemble moon over parador this film had a slightly silly story but it was a fantasy after all and the casting and the acting was spot on dreyfuss was perfect as the actor impostor full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have you get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes this was one of dreyfuss s best roles just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator and the parting scene like something out of casablanca indeed raul julia was superb as the paradorian chief of secret police he gets some really funny lines some of which are homages to other films like round up the usual suspects and sonia braga was excellent as the girl friend in addition to being a really hot number you should get an oscar for tonight let us not forget johnny winters as the cia agent and the several guest stars playing themselves sammy davis jr ike pappas dick cavett all perfectly done all in all a memorable romp under the paradorian moon r 
333,i ve seen this film at least 4 times since 84 and it s still great every time i see it it s a very compelling version of the opera carmen with amazing flamenco dancing bare bones sets and of course wonderful music this telling of carmen is a story within a story with each paralleling the other until the doubly tragic ending obviously a low budget spanish production the film contains dancing by some of spain s premier flamenco dancers the combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage makes the telling of the story even more powerful it s independent movie making at it s best and probably my all time favorite foreign film 
144,in 17th century japan there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages his name was mayeda he is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5 000 muscats from the king of spain whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved japan shogun mayeda is a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents starring cinema legends sho kosugi tenchu stealth assassins christopher lee star wars lord of the rings trilogy john rhys davies lord of the rings trilogy indiana jones trilogy and toshiro milfune the seven samurai throne of blood shogun mayeda kabuto is a film masterpiece the osaka winning stunt team bought to the screen by bob ivy bring exciting battle action sequences such as the opening battle against the eastern army the attack on mayeda s ship carrying priceless jewels and the final confrontation between sho kosugi and david essex a fine musical score by famed composer john scott is also present director sho kusugi was not even nominated for an oscar for this film which deals with the emotional strife such as the death of mayedas family the search for love and acceptance after grieving all of which is dealt with extremely well highly recommended cinematic masterpiece please note all of the above is opposite for the film in question 
992,for the uninitiated almost any andy milligan film is a shock but despite the fact that i ve seen many of his films this one still takes the cake for sheer shoddiness this is of course milligan s take on the sweeney todd tale done with period costumes but not necessarily period hairstyles in some cases and the usual headache inducing camera work grainy quality as for the gore well the version i saw may have been cut some for there s not a lot for a film with bloodthirsty in the title the best indication of subversive film making here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victim s tit so while i will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf it s definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though recommended for only the foolhardy morbidly curious 3 out of 10 
570,yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money just how commercial did this film prove the film council who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded on one of the london undergrounds disused stations for allowing this clichéd dismal specimen to be committed to film a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate most notably deathline amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute it s a little bit too late then surely all those development executives at the uk film council could have noticed this at the script stage add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare 
521, lies tells about an affair between an 18 year old bucktoothed female student and a scrawny 38 year old married man with the pair of protags spending about half the screen time engaged in naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half meandering through the pathetically naive storyline which seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes with very poor production value including obvious sanitary appliances and phony softcore sex to a story which is a messy mix of comedy and drama lies quickly becomes redundant ad nauseam with an almost 2 hour run subtitles and so little substance lies is simply not recommendable c 
657, dead letter office is a low budget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service struggling to rebuild their damaged lives unfortunately the acting is poor and the links between the characters past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over schematically represented what s most disappointing of all however is the portrayal is life in the office of the film s title there s no mechanisation whatsoever and it s quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living granted part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s if it ever truly existed it s a shame as the film s overall tone is poignant and wry and there s some promise in the scenario but few of the details convince overall it feels the work of someone who hasn t actually experienced much of real life a student film with a concept and an outline but sadly little else 
165,i was not making big assumptions on the fact that this for sure was a very very free adaptation from the work of eça de queiroz and i must say that this free adaptation form the book as a lot of possible good ideas and characters the problem is the way that is done without any care without any taste just a rumble of bad taste clichés everywhere the script is so fake and the characters so unreal that s makes petty seeing nice actors as unas bryner morgado lagarto and others lost themselves in a net of whatever except cinema or storytelling for my surprise the newcomers jorge corrula and soraia chaves bravely stick in their performances but you can see them lost like a drifted boat without any direction and talking about direction this seems to be something totally missing on this movie where s the director everything is bad taste the frames are whatever and whenever the use of hand camera without any justified reason the light design that should build environments doesn t exist and no excuses that the all point is a dark real story the problem overall in this trying to be film is that as no taste or very very bad taste it s sad to see jorge and soraia melting away in such fake and gratuity sex scenes painted here and there trough out the movie like closing narratives holes or used as fakes transition motives maybe carlos coelho da silva should see the 2002 carlos carrera adaptation of the same book of eça and get the felling of how to build a true movie 
374,well this is a typical straight to the toilet slasher film long story short a bunch of teenagers young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage naked women teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky gory death scenes the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff but never bra less a creepy crazy man who knows about the evil lesbian kiss scene sex being a killer no ploteven then for a cheesy slasher film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead nothing not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold give the demonic 0 10 
347,being relatively young i didn t know how bad anti semitism was in brooklyn where my family is originally from this movie absolutely horrified me i ve seen many movies about prejudice racism and anti semitism but this seemed to hit me harder than most this was definitely one of the best indie films i ve ever seen i had to travel 45 minutes to see it and it was well worth it nearly everything about the movie was great sometimes it was a little slow but that didn t really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric it took place in the 40s and it really did look like it was the 40s the acting was great william h macy as always was wonderful so was laura dern and i was pleasantly surprised by meatloaf s performance playing the vicious anti semite neighbor 9 10

826,i remember loving this show when i was a kid i thought the helicopter was the coolest thing i ve seen it was ultra high tech for it s time it could repel enemy fire do all sorts of acrobatics in the air and take down nearly anything in it s way now i go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is the casts members are hardly compelling there are a lot of cheesy moments and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking and nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage lot of the footages appear to date from the vietnam war era airwolf has basically the same theme as knight rider except the crime fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car after watching a few episodes i found myself utterly bored i do however love the theme music 
121,i had seen this movie long time back but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me a wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of australian commandos who tried to sink some japanese ships at the singapore harbor during the height of ww2 these commandos are caught in plain clothes and they are considered to be spies by the japanese captors but something happens that hasn t been explored much in any hollywood ww2 movie that i have seen a close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives they begin to respect each other while the captain of the captured australian soldiers become the best of friends with a senior japanese prison guard this is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really tugs your heart soon one day as the two friends are conversing the aussie captain learns that some other captives are going to be tried and executed for the sinking of the jap ships in the singapore harbor he mentions that it was his team and not some other s that had sunk the ships to his japanese friend and upon hearing this the japanese guard tells him to keep quiet as it might lead to his whole group getting executed but the captain remains adamant on confessing this to the japanese authorities finally the japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most respectful way that is according to their rules this is the highest honor accorded to the captured warriors in japan this is the most awesome part of the film where the aussie soldiers are awaiting their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why did his aussie friend confess being guilty i won t give away the ending here but it is more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears all in all an excellent underrated movie that possibly didn t get the recognition that it deserved internationally get one copy today and be mesmerized 
866,watching the preview of armored i thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film thankfully the movie was entertaining suspenseful and realistic there never is the perfect crime and armored showed why the movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals the last hour of the film is very entertaining matt dillon is still a very good actor hard to believe dillon is 50 years of age i would buy this movie i give armored eight out of ten not a christmas movie did i write ten lines yet nope anyways there is not to many action films armored has a lot of excitement in it which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy 
338,miyazaki has been doing his mojo since the 70s and it s only been recently that his movies have made it american shores via disney and fans fawning over his great talent ponyo is no exception although some of his other movies have been a bit more accessible to us audiences some may find this one a bit on the fence being sort of japanese in its presentation for the same reason pom poko is very japanese and doesn t make much sense to us audiences so too are some elements of ponyo this should not detract you from watching this fun film of growth hope and friendship what does come across well is miyazaki s very elaborate and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy that coupled with his characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters he steps out of his zone a bit with ponyo as the main character is a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mom while his dad is away at work on the high seas although not lonely sosuke is just like any other curious boy who likes adventure and allure of the sea similar to spirited away we see the different worlds of the humans and the sea creatures and i feel that miyazaki may be trying to draw the viewers attention to the vast and undiscovered nature of things that live beneath the sea and our acceptance of them and thing that are different i managed to watch the subtitled version of this last year and was pleased by the story and plot miyazaki has claimed that this is my last movie for many years but shortly after spirited away he gave us howl s moving castle ponyo is certainly proof that miyazaki has not hung up his spurs and continues to delight innovate and pioneer the most creative animated movies of all time watch ponyo with an open mind and a tip of the hat to childhood fantasy and imagination and you ll be transported back to when catching fireflies and secret hiding places were more important than boring grown up stuff and eating your vegetables 
332,i was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of l anglaise in this beautifully acted intellectually and visually compelling film thank you so much monsieur le directeur rohmer 
216,as a gamer i can t say i like this film fact is i down right hate it i tried to watch it as open minded as possible but when it gets down to it it feels rather insulting to my social group to me there are several reasons why 1 the characters seem unnatural i ve met lots of players of all different walks of life i don t know any who act like any of the characters in the film it s like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people most gamers are rather social people some with rather active lives 2 the style doesn t work the mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film an actual documentary on gamers would actually work better while it is good looking i e cleanly put together it isn t very good 3 the dialogue feels forced unnatural it also seems to lack any real world context gamers swear i ll admit that but we don t have tourette s syndrome 4 the humor is lacking while self deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups i ve encountered this is less self deprecation and more like toilet humor likewise a large part of gamer humor is full of in jokes and anecdotes not toilet humor most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes 5 the biggest problem to me is basically this accuracy i don t mean rules but instead dynamics invariably this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the gamers and the gamers dorkness rising both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game the difference is gamers the movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs the gamers where you can say something like huh i know a guy like that yep that s definitely like gary 
910,there are good bad movies and bad bad movies and enjoyably bad movies this isn t one of them this is a movie that doesn t realize just how bad it is i saw this at a screening on november 14 2006 at the new beverly theater in los angeles as part of the grindhouse cinema this theater puts on every month hopefully presenters eric caiden co will think twice before letting writer director lawrenece foldes anywhere near them again what a con man the guy got up to speak before the film you would think he was orson welles talking about touch of evil or some other lost classic hardly nice of him to take up 20 minutes of the audiences time with his incoherent rambling young warriors has been described as a cross between animal house and death wish but if you are expecting something along the lines of imitations like revenge of the nerds or the exterminator you will be in for one sad disappointment the script makes zero sense the direction is so poor the actors looked embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is watching a car blow up poor richard shaft roundtree in this movie he plays another character with the first name of john but that s about the only similarity his character here has to the aforementioned classic i hope this film allowed him to pay the rent for another month other actors who look like they wished they could be anywhere else included ernest borgnine and linda day george this is a complete waste of time even the audience did not seem that into it except for the one spazz boy sitting in the back who yelled whoa every five minutes and his girlfriend who giggled with the fervor of a lobotomized talking barbie every time he opened his mouth for real films about vigilantes i would suggest the following death wish i ii iii exterminator i vigilante force ms 45 rolling thunder the no mercy man the latter two being a pair of films presented at this theater a couple of years ago probably the same budget as young warriors but both were a million times better :D
70,don t quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldn t have been much comedy i also don t think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesn t change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic i d say but happy it s a light hearted movie with a feel good ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and i m glad they didn t show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly 
994,a young girl surviving as a prostitute a cheap hustler who wants to get the big score they meet each other in thailand you may think by the opening titles it s going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life this film feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes of images but still refreshing this story is also about eros and thanatos it s not an original joke but it is well told says a character and that also applies to this one we ve seen the story but this way we see it thailand appears in hot tones the photograph going from one colored to a multicolored place and it captures the city as the cage of this imperfect persons there is also a good use of the music to dot the actions 
388,when i read the synopsis for messiah in the television guide i was not prepared for what was in store the story follows dci metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across london he soon realises a pattern there is a serial killer on the loose killing people with similar names and jobs to those of the 12 apostles and their killings are identical to their matching apostle the two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat with metcalfe closely pursuing the killer but always missing him within a couple of seconds and discovering the gruesome mess he has left behind of his ill fated victim messiah is sure to cause a great deal of controversy but nonetheless it is the greatest piece of drama the bbc has shown in a long time 
763,icarly is about a teenage girl named carly shay miranda cosgrove who lives with her artist brother spencer in a loft in seattle carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes tons of money a year so much money she doesn t even know its a real number her best friend is sam janette mccrudy who s as predictable as they come she says normal things and beats up carly s neighbor freddie who is in charge of all the technical things for their web show carly shouts every word and looks like she doesn t have emotion sam chases freddie around and freddie screams in one episode carly and her friends shoot lewbert the doorman down in elevator and he survives i would not recommend this at all unless you like teenagers shouting hurting people and making fun of stuff 
557,this is a very dull film with poorly developed characters subplots that go nowhere and barely tolerable acting it comes across as a poorly conceived rip off of 2001 the only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects but even that wasn t enough to keep me from nodding off i would like to get the soundtrack especially the music during the space flight sequence for nights when i have trouble falling asleep 
40,steve martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy he absolutely does not fit this part like the woeful remake of the out of towners this movie falls flat on it s face how anybody ever thought steve martin could even come close to jack lemmon s wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie dan ackroyd could have played the bilko part better martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people s classic work it s a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over the line the producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the united states army was just about the only line that actually made me laugh if you want to see the real bilko get hold of the original episodes of the phil silvers show those are guaranteed to make you laugh unlike this mistake that should never have happened i put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned lemmon classic and the remake of psycho none of them should ever have happened 
936,nothing is worse than the genocides of our world s history this film attempts to describe the horror faced by one particular family a common narrative device in the atomic bomb world of hiroshima the most memorable parts are the graphic and saddening images that the people of hiroshima face in the aftermath of war the story however becomes more concerned with the effect on a specific group of people and how they cope with getting on with their lives in other words if you don t really care about them the film grows boring it s hard not to care though when a family s homeland is wrecked i m not sure if i would recommend this film because it says very little politically and honestly did not keep my interest in the family s troubles 
602,a review i have put off for far too long bluntly 2001 is one of the best science fiction films made to date if not the very best stanley kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works and although it is misunderstood by many and respectively underrated it is considered one of the best films of all time and i ll have to agree back in 1968 no one had done anything like this before and no one has since it was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then and seeing how the effects hold up today it is no wonder as to why the film still looks marvelous after almost forty years take note cgi people through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid this aspect alone almost single handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects i can t think of another film where you can t here anything in space like it is in reality not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood and it works flawlessly aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film the music played all classical compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man s journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler the story while seemingly simple is profound sequentially several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film what are they where did they come from what do they do these are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way while most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story each individual will have to decide what it means to them any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions it s not left entirely up to interpretation but in some aspects it is experience it for more clarification the end result is quite chilling no matter your personal solution while it is a long film and sometimes slows down it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man it s not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film faster paced feature those with short attention spans need not apply last but not least is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist hal 9000 the computer never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence which reminds me for a film with such profound ambition and execution there is surprisingly little dialogue another sign of kubrick s genius all in all one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made a personal favorite everyone must see this film at least once very highly recommended 
830, sky captain and the world of tomorrow an amazingly incovenient title is simply a bad movie it has no heart no deep ideas nothing very special about it yes the cgi backgrounds look interesting but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus additionally the movie uses music the same way as say gilligan s island or the scooby doo cartoons it never stops terribly simply terrible there are no fresh ideas either just gobs and gobs and gobs and etc of bits taken from older movies and serials there is no gatekeeper here the movie just seems to exist because it can save your money and your time not entertaining at all 
146,make up your own mind personally i found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from stevie wonder no offense mr wonder maybe it is comedy but i just found it stupid not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids wheeler seann william scott and danny paul rudd two energy drink salesmen to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by gayle sweeny jane lynch one of the misfits is ronnie bobb e j thompson a foul mouthed fifth grader and the other is augie christopher mintz plasse a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world wheeler and danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life love and heavy metal lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies supporting are elizabeth banks ken jeongg kerri kenney silver amanda righetti and david wain 
971,this movie is all flash and no soul the actors put a lot of passion into the numbers but these numbers often didn t connect with the film and felt like stand alone music videos and no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you every single one sounds like its coming from a studio essentially sucking all the life from the songs off the stage the performances were all dull and unrealized especially hudson who essentially plays the same angry strong she s stubborn and selfish black woman we ve seen before there was absolutely no depth to her character nor any of the other female leads though i think the movie wants us to believe that hudson s character faces hardship because of her weight it is really her own refusal to do what s best for the team that lands her in trouble making the end of the film totally meaningless hudson s academy award is a joke there was no justification when she sang she put forth emotion though it was often misplaced but this was the writer director s fault but when she was just acting she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character eddie murphy s character is the only one with an arc and he did a fine job but still not oscar worthy the only actor who really brought something to the roll was danny glover who took a small relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it there is nothing here to sink your teeth into no drama or heart or even laughs the placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one the number when hudson is arguing with the other girls is so long winded if it had been any longer it could pass for a family guy skit the movie has no idea what it s about and i felt insulted by the last few minutes it s a big boring waste of time and really is the worst film i saw in 06 and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with 
149,i really liked this film all three stars connery fishburne and underwood give credible performances and harris is enjoyably over the top the lighting and shot angles in some of harris scenes make his face look truly diabolical the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting not a great movie but an enjoyable one i gave it 7 of 10 
571,i watched this film awhile ago and the only thing i can remember about the film is how absolutely horribly outstandingly bad it was its definitely in my top 5 worst films i have ever seen and to think i had to persuade my mates to get this film out at the video shop my reputation has been shot to bits because of this film will my mates ever trust me again i doubt it they always say don t judge something by its cover they were right when i saw the cover to skins gang boys i thought wow this looks great as it had a load of skin heads on the front cover running riot with metal bars don t watch this film i can t think of anything else to say the acting is bad the story is bad its just bad 
738,the film made no sense to me whatsoever good actors sergiocastellittoaparticular favourite he was great in uomo dellestelle thestarmaker but that was made by giuseppe tornatore a great italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort but awful rambling script terrible editing and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say and ended up saying exactly nothing apretentious load of rubbish but the sort of film that certain italianpseudo intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it and unfortunately italy has no monopoly on these they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece i never thought much of bellochio as director i remember seeing his first film pugninella tasca fists in the pocket or some such title in rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago i was living thereat the time all the usual pseudos raved about it but it left me pretty cold i didn t think he was much of a director then and still don t age has certainly not improved him and this film must rank as one of his worst 
0,this anime series starts out great interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not everything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the sci fi thriller giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho babble and quasi religious preachy exploitation if you want to hear you re ok it s good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good sci fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy 
986,i had no idea who bruce haack was before seeing this film i had just seen the moog doc which was alright the only problem was moog led a very content life and the doc was well content haack s story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days but it carries a great deal of heart with it though the film doesn t go into the tragic stuff so much one can sense that bruce accepted the price of making music his way there are so many elements that make up his legacy ie invention of the peopleodian where bruce could actually play music by touching people it must have been challenging to document haack s scatter brained output which pretty much fell into every musical category imaginable even rap music but the director cut the piece together very coherently and managed to capture the spirit and the cast what a group of characters bruce surrounded himself with but what do you expect from a telepathic guru tripping with kids fighting against the music industry i recommend this film to anyone interested in music history it s that mainstream but that important 
679,i ticked the contains spoiler box in case i say anything that is a spoiler and don t realise i ve said it until i re read it after i ve posted so it s just in case anyhow back to reviewing this film i saw this film on skymovies earlier on this afternoon and by the description sky gives you these people must be on acid it sounded pretty good but then when i actually got about 30 minutes into it i was appalled this film in my opinion has the worst scriptwriting and actors actresses ever the young girl who falls in love with the boy from l a after about 3 hours is a really stupid lame character who has an annoying whiney voice and boff hair then there s her lover who s an idiot and is also very whiney actually maybe they suit each other then there s the boy s mum who s with him on holiday and surprise surprise she s a doctor and oh my god wait there s even more unsuspected surprises a virus suddenly breaks out on the island and she knows all about viruses o shock horror yeah right lol then there s this insane religious lad who keeps going on about erbs or something and how the lord knows all everyone on the island seems to love him yet he s actually a stubborn arrogant steroid pumped you really need to watch this film just for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a swim his head is like tiny and his body is massive it s hilarious buffoon who s had way too much to drink anyhow after all these weirdo characters including a stoned looking taxi driver the religious lad finally gives in to the doctor and she takes a blood sample and they get straight to work on finding the cure from that because for some reason he s dramatically been saved all down to erbs and god and oh my god yes there s another surprise you ll never guess what just in the nick of time with 11 minutes to go before everybody on the island drops dead in fact including her son and his girl she finds the cure and injects everybody and it s all resolved what a pathetic film i mean i knew it sounded an obvious ending from when i first started watching it but i actually though it d be good and have some sub plot twists somewhere but no no it was just boring and dry don t watch this film you ll end up like me stunned for 3 hours and then demanding the hour and a half you spent of your life watching it back 
829,the film looks like as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorists it should actually be called dino crap there is nothing good about this movie even the actors are not worth a penny don t waste your time watching this movie the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie i mean isn t he ashamed of looking at peoples faces after they have seen his movie the dinocroc looks as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut and paste stuff and its the same old story man plays god creates some creature it escapes and is happy eating people and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt has to come and kill it bla bla u will figure out the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
564,rowan atkinson s mr bean ranks right up there with laurel hardy buster keaton the marx brothers and other comedy greats i have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when i introduced them to mr bean via my videos and now dvds i ll never forget the first time my brother saw him he was over for a visit and i asked him if he d ever seen mr bean who he said so i got out my video and showed him the one where mr bean is in church and starts to nod off my brother laughed so hard he fell out of the chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard he became an instant fan of mr bean we all know how hilarious these episodes are but the fun is in sharing them with others i have seen so many people laugh til it hurts favorite episodes are the visit of the queen the hotel room stay late for the dentist appointment the christmas episode a classic plus kids love it and the new year party rowan atkinson is a comic genius 
4,it ll soon be 10 yrs since this movie was released still makes me laugh if u enjoy this film try the new hera pheri t is as hilarious and my favourite bit of the film must be when salman realises that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point and he actually says it out loud u just wanna bash him but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing fantastic film 10 10
643, tip have it read to you heres how 1 copy and paste this to notepad not word 2 go to start all programs accessories accessabilty narratorhaving your testicles ironed when jonathan ross started his career he was on a show call the last resort now a days he is the first resort to host anything and anything tv award shows that half the time he is up for nominations in comic relief chat shows quiz shows game shows charity shows brighton just when you at you wits end and think you can find salvation in the wireless the lisping twang of good old j r hits you like a freight train going none stop from texas to downtown n y that has lost a hour and is trying to make it up about this show fnwjr its a normal chat show format with j r as host and a house band that concisest of four gay men ha ha ha ow my aching sides and season one had andy davis but he left or was fired to give way to ross s ego ross will more less use his guests as props and you really don t hear them speak because of his its my ball and i ll take it home attitude you also see that the bigger the guest the more he is willing to lie and suck up to them to get in with the big boys like the weak kid at school who hangs round with the bully however when a small reality t v star comes on he ll happily humiliate them asking personal questions about the past and telling them about their lack of talent to get the laughs sometimes he will under estimate the popularity of a guest say something to belittle them and then when the audience act shocked he will quickly turn and start making himself the fall guy the best example of this was when life on mars star john simm came on and he said how does someone like you get work your ok looking but not hollywood good looking bare in mind the hugh jackman and halle berry was in the green room he was really only trying to suck up to them before they were even on the couch when the audience acted shock ross quickly said what i m bit light headed from wearing that corset i don t know what i m saying if he don t have any low forms of tv life on he ll just dig at the four gay men on the piano with jokes more out of date than his fashion its very much a different story when a hollywood a lister or big tv star comes on the show in that he ll tell them stories to humor them when some actor explains that he was in a support band then jonathon ross will say something like wow well he ever i go to see a band i was try to look interested for the support band to make them feel as though they are wanted with an underline message being please like me i was probably one of the people that cheered you when you was in your band top this off with an audience of ross fans so hooked on every bad old joke and bulling it really makes for a poor show your better off watching us chat shows instead they are more scripted but not anywhere near as hard to watch 
100,killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1 bad acting bad characters annoying clown bad lines you name it honestly i m not all that surprised that more people haven t seen this movie the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes they didn t this movie is just as bad if not worse than the first one that clown that goddamn clown i hate him i hate him so much and i don t hate him because he is a good villain i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is unrepairable the last thing we need is a killjoy 3 
496,ok this movie was the worst display i have seen in years the actors weren t to bad i figured it was a b movie so they were doing b movie acting anyways i watched this movie thinking oh cool a ufo sci fi movie wrong it was just an excuse for radical christians to push a message onto people the last scene was extremely messed up that is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something what someone believe in is a matter of opinion this movie just shows how corrupted religion is especially christianity if you want to watch a b movie this ain t if you want to watch a movie that is trying to brainwash the masses well this is the pick of the litter go right for it if you are going to convey a message do it don t force it ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such a degree especially christians 
808,heather graham is not just a pretty face she is also an extremely talented actress she adds a unique flavour to the movie overall it s an intelligent and yet compassionate look at love marriage and relationships i thoroughly enjoyed it
