103, voodoo academy features an academy like no other one that houses only six male students in one bedroom these teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously the sole administrator of this academy is a young and seductive headmistress and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash so to speak sexual overtones abound and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the academy and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie if you re not interested in the male form stay away burdened by weak and awkward dialogue this low budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns the mood is claustrophobic with tediously long takes a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue intended as character and plot development it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days 
872,another fantastic offering from the monkey island team and though it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of ron gilbert it s another worthy installment my only gripe is that it was a little short seeming in comparison to the previous two though that might be because of a glorious lack of disk swapping roll on mi4 
846,i have to be 100 honest with you fellow imdb users i wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster doesn t charlotte gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way i m in love with that woman i got what i expected but only half this film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations while i don t agree with another fellow imdb user who states that the movie is overrated i must admit that pr√©te moi ta main has plenty of flaws my main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters there isn t a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment of romance or even a clue to suggest that they re interested in each other in fact the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward when both are in the couch and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest i didn t buy the dinner sequence still the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise i mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days i understand it s a movie and that s why i accept it as a funny situation plus the humor is versatile there are moments involving s m funny lines with chabat s best friend some lesbian references funny situations involving the family women and more charlotte gaionsbourg s performance is top notch and she s by far the reason to watch the movie she s funny sexy looks very thin and fine and demonstrates she s a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance alain chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance i think the supporting cast do what they can the score art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits it s a good example of feel good cinema 
76,the film did what it set out to do show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity however for most of us this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here the movie fixated on breasts which soon became boring and i lost interest if this was on tv i would ve switched to the latest news on the starr report that s how boring i found this movie 
610,batman returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films its predecessor batman in my opinion is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre for one to say that batman returns was disappointing he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of danny devito as the penguin devito and walken offer some memorable moments the tale of batman is suppose to be dark and tim burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays batman batman returns provides comic relief action suspense and fantasy and it should not be viewed as crap although we are all entitled to our own opinions 
608,just a comment on new orleans accents an earlier reviewer noted the following this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country there was also another comment along these lines from an english reviewer many people in new orleans do in fact sound broklynese i have never found out why it s mentioned in a confederacy of dunces by john kennedy toole i always appreciate movies taking place in new orleans that include this detail as this one did too often it s just the hollywood version of the standard southern accent 
359,i suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality when shows like search ufo and 6m man were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future adventure and technology you got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them the only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it they didn t get to take your show and add in their own comments over it i did not know what this concept of a pilot was i saw the movie and was hoping thru out that stryker would get home did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hours back then would i understood what so many people hate about the movie now i doubt it because i don t remember it as such do i understand now not really for to understand the story one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie if one is watching as an american it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police state but if one is a subject in that state then compliance could be expected and security can be less when things are suppose to be perfect perfect to an extreme degree perfect that one is not suppose to doubt then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of order the subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere or that the police state values knowledge to some extent for they are careful about how they control or harm their brain power these days one is likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it so much of the suspense surprise is lost but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut s biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr one gets quite a distance into the movie before it becomes apparent that such a possibility is the least of his concerns this is the primary difference between the stranger and doppelganger the latter can be considered timeless since any comments it has about the ussr are comparatively minor and lost early on in the movie in the former those links are through out the movie supposedly directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after wards all that said despite my fond memory for the movie it is rather easy to see that it would not have made it as a series each week stryker would make friends benedict would chase stryker would get away eventually benedict s society would get rid of him someone else would pick up the chase a rut would develop there might be a jab at something new such as perhaps another crew member from stryker s mission showing up but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going if one goes in with the knives that others have used to slash the movie odds are they will slash it as well but if one remembers that this was made during the cold war and what fears and estimations of the other side were during that time of what the popular environment contained for the viewer then they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it 
192,well i was going to wait till this came out on video to see it and i wish i had i actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day and it made me yearn for more of the same what i got was airplane on crack i mean if you like airplane or any other leslie nielsen vehicles then you ll probably be in heaven but if your used to the usually wayans comedy then you will be dissapointed there was alot more eye candy in this one which will keep young hormone raged teenage boys happy which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out i enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder and part one 5 times as much odd that the better of the 3 is part 2 but then again i always liked halloween 2 better then the original as well maybe its just me the funniest part of the movie has to be the way the aliens say goodbye but that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on video tape and then rent it dont buy it 
24,sometimes it is difficult to watch films with subtitles in this case danish but the watching is worth it as the story progresses the reasoning for the choice of two sisters to take care of their father is questionable but their society is different their choice leaves them alone until a french woman comes there may be a question on why the french woman came to their place to stay and this is never fully developed the feast which happens later as a result of unexpected funds from france is a source of unusual pleasure to all who attend and something they have not experienced before it provides a fitting thank you for the kindnesses given to the guest filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty it is a beautiful experience for the viewer 
807,the things that i find irritating on screen the things i nitpick about and annoy the people who try to watch movies with me are those moment where the writer director set designer on screen caterer or whoever doesn t think it through to the end and by a single act of omission or commission undoes all the other work done by everyone else who has worked on the movie that moment of wait a bloody minute what just happened that stops the narrative dead in its tracks not that this film s narrative needed a lot of stopping because anyone who has ever seen it will know that quintet s narrative drive has pretty well frozen solid before the end of the opening shot there are several of those moments in this movie and you get so long to think about them too the film is two hours long and the scripted dialogue probably ran to five pages there s a lot of time to ponder its deficiencies the movie is set in a frozen earth another ice age has set in and the whole world is dying it s cold very cold it s actually very cold on the screen the movie was shot in canada in winter and there are icicles and real snow and people s breath misting from their mouths in every scene time and again we are reminded how fecking cold it is people wear big hats and layers and layers of clothes and waddle around like over dressed weeble people must have been a horrible shoot my nitpick comes in a sequence when our hero checks into a room of a hotel woken up in the middle of the night by voices coming from the room next door he overhears a conversation of vital importance to the meagre plot through an large grill in the wall dividing the two rooms i m not questioning why there is a convenient grill in the wall between the two rooms what got me annoyed was the fact that the grill had not been blocked up by the long term tenant with the noisy visitor if you are trying to keep warm the last thing you need is a huge gaping draughty hole in your wall that leads into an unoccupied unheated room trust me i live like this i watched this film sat on my living room sofa under a duvet with a hot water bottle my breath was misting as much as the actors if that whacking great hole was in my wall i d block it up with something maybe not the best choice of movie to watch in an unheated room in midwinter but boy did it make me notice the lousy insulation in the film 
543,this is probably the best horror film made since ed wood died i can t spoil the ending because i have absolutely no idea what happened i ll try my best though there are some kind of lesbian vampires but they keep swapping bodies so any character might or might not be the character you re supposed to think it is or it might be a lesbian vampire sound confusing it s not as confusing as you might think since none of the characters make any sense to begin with there s no plot no character development and random people show up speak a few lines and then disappear never to be heard from again there are also zombies who are possibly the enemies of the vampires but there s also a dream within a dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital so maybe none of this actually happened and it s all the main character s hallucination the upside both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly the special effects are simply mind boggling i particularly liked the incredibly slow awkward fight sequences everyone has a really silly canadian accent which adds to the general level of hilarity well worth the price of rental we laughed until we cried 
966,i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector in fact they double took me a few times so it s hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon cheryl lockett alexander leesville louisiana i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector in fact they double took me a few times so it s hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon cheryl lockett alexanderleesville louisiana
495,what about scream baby scream is supposed to make me not feel like a fool for buying it i bought it because god help me i m a sucker for old b cinema even as worthless as this nonetheless something about this movie irritates me it s probably janet janet comes off cold snooty seemingly with the intention of coming off as deep and noble with a look on her face that screams constipation she can t seem to agree to anything her uptight boyfriend wants i m glad that this is her only role what really irritates me is that this is a 1960 s gore film gone terribly awry and as we all know awry is floridian for zero gore it s like the director started with a herschell lewis style but backed out of the gore scenes when his wife found out so instead we end up with one dull conversation after the other and basically a whole lot of irritating nothing in other words we end up with florida bore joseph adler should be embarrassed janets boyfriend jason is almost as ridiculous as she is this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything come to think of it he s probably the least likable good guy in horror history the only thing this movie really has going for it is that it carries that 60 s early 70 s b gore vibe that you can find in stuff like undertaker his pals blood freak or most anything from herschell lewis even rodney from the gruesome twosome is in this i ithought his caveman comedy routine was irritating most everything from reel to reel is stupid even the trip scene was stupid the only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery but that mostly includes janet whining about life not being perfect in the only real ironic twist scream baby scream gets even less interesting once the story finally gets started around the 45 minute mark if you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable but are offended by the color red you might not hate this why does troma distribute this wouldn t this be something weird video s area scream baby scream very well may be the worst in florida horror gore of its era but i suppose underneath the unlikeable characters and the incoherent plot lies potential scream baby scream really just seems like it should follow the blood feast pattern so to steal a quote from janet if it doesn t fit i throw it out 2 10
344,this show was a really good one in many ways although certainly an atypical western with the hero riding around on a motorcycle rather than a horse due to the 1914 setting very late for a western which tend usually to be set between 1866 and 1890 i remember some controversy about its cancellation at the time but didn t really watch it during its time on nbc when i came to see it and love it was a decade later when i was in the army stationed in germany and it was shown every week from the beginning on armed forces television by then margot kidder was famous as lois lane but i ll also always think of her as nichols girlfriend in a lot of ways nichols was a lot like maverick both were much more attracted to getting rich with little effort than they were fighting it was in the little tv magazine that they distributed at the px not really an authorized edition of tv guide but made to resemble it as closely as possible without getting into copyright trouble that i first learned the real story behind the cancellation i really wonder what the next season with the more violent twin would have been like if they had really made it as planned of course by the time this show was made the western era of tv had been in decline for around a decade someday i hope to be able to write that the reality era has been in decline for that long while gunsmoke and bonanza were still running they were both nearing their ends and it had been years since a new western had really caught on i think that this trend did a lot to hold nichols back and was the main reason that nbc executives doubted that it would ever find a large audience but to me a good western unlike a show set in contemporary times is somewhat timeless as are other period shows changing fashions and the like do nothing to make them look any more dated than they were supposed to be and i think that watching this show 10 years after it was produced is really what brought this point home to me also this show is an early pairing of garner and stuart margolin who is really one of the all time great sidekicks and not just in westerns 
385,this is the second and best in the hunting trilogy what makes it the best is the clever dialogue bugs do you want to shoot me now or wait till you get home it was kind of funny how they kept that going through out the short 
900,men of honor has many great aspects to it good action sequences plenty of feel good scenes a good musical score but the part that really makes the movie is the great acting mostly by robert deniro the story of men of honor is focused about carl brashear played by cuba gooding jr who wants to be the first african american deep sea diver in the navy it chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further it is a good story but it seems like it has been done many times before a person against all of the odds won t give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago it could happen but a lot of the struggles the brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the c o of the diving school tampering with his final test however all of that is made up for the scene when robert deniro finally enters the movie deniro plays mater chief sunday who is the teacher at the diving school brashear is attending as soon as deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can t hate unless you have incredible wilpower before the movie ends deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out in the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film but admit it if it was all the truth it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes 
871,when i found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses meryl streep and wynona ryder i went through the roof but i had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and i still have the bruise first of all the character that jeremy irons an actor i still admire even after this disappointment plays was just awful he treated his family like crap especially his sister played by glenn close i could not get close or sympathize with any of the characters and i m no prude but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could have been toned down wynona and antonio s characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate and what was with meryl s character and her mystical powers why didn t they go into this more this film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here 
598,i had never heard of this film until it came to dvd i was immediately intrigued by everything about it the actors the title the cover and especially the author arthur miller you can t go wrong with him can you yep i haven t read the novel but i m going to guess it was a lot better than the film i had high hopes for this movie i love macy and dern and it looked interesting unfortunately this film never really rises above cookie cutter messages about racism and bigotry if you ve never seen any other films that deal with this subject or if you never knew that america was founded on bigotry then maybe this film will wow you others will probably find it predictable stale and overall bland 
260,i ve seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it the conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually is although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable luckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it 
542,not much to say beyond the summary save that this is an example of j edgar s hoover s constant attention to maintaining a good pr profile they don t make movies this bad very often especially with the likes of jimmy stewart and vera miles in the blend too bad 
51,this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen the stark scenery the isolation the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication the acting is completely natural but for me as a foodie the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well whether or not the cafe anglais really exists i don t know but i do know of similar establishments and babette s menu and choice of wines are authentic and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be this is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it
941,i loved this film not being a swooning ed wood jr fan i prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings his movies are fun but his personal story is one racked with pain i hoped and was delighted to find that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise from beginning to end this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives positive and negative and showing us their character as much as ed s we get insight into ed s personal and professional life from his romances to his drinking to his sexuality to his friends to his enemies and even to his film making the film itself is shot in a low budget way that seems done out of respect for ed as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies and new comers will be amazed that this man was real the dvd is full of impossible to find gems crossroads of lorado and photo galleries but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse to the point where one woman will go down in history as swimming pool owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool this ability to define a person s legacy comes through universally as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created somehow without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement even the title hints at the b list horror genre but by the end we see that even this is a kindness what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood s legend in many ways a living contradiction ed wood jr could not be condensed to a single viewpoint this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get being itself a juxtaposition of themes it is at once respectful provocative thoughtful gripping fun sad kind and fulfilling 
71,poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure you re in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life 
405,almost a two person play and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important neither are particularly good this might have been stronger in fact if it had first been crafted as a two person play and then worked into a film anyway a twitchy vampire who seems slightly autistic becomes infatuated with a stripper as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home he wants to have her tell him about the daylight he would have been better off finding someone with a day job or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet but then they might not have a hot bod after he gets her to do whatever he wants and he s not terribly good at it he intends to feed on her at 6 am at which point the sun rises much is made of that deadline despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding it will just make him hungrier additionally he claims he can t let the stripper go since she knows about him but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is there are a lot of inconsistencies why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime i m not sure with all the time in the world you d think he d have done a better job or fixed the place up a bit he s clearly not a wealthy vampire this is supposedly a remake and i m curious to see the original version of this dance of the damned although that was directed by katt shea and the other films she directed for corman stripped to kill stk ii were pretty bad 
599,there is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award well it does not deserve an audience as well ironically one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least every frame you feel you are getting the full picture its like someone is cropping your view from the edges the story is pathetic well i will be honest i could not bear to watch the entire movie the part that sucked the most was when i saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor these and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of steven seagal take my advice stay away from this piece of crap 
178,if you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes this cartoon is not for you but if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation come on in in this cartoon popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what looks like a japanese fishing boat the two japanese fishermen trick popeye into thinking that they want a peace treaty signed but looks can be deceiving the fishing boat turns out to be a japanese navy ship what follows is considered today to be morale boosting propaganda be forewarned the representations of the japanese in the film are done in a mean spirited fashion keep in mind though that there was a war going on at the time but i strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the wwii era 
115, some spoilers it took some 19 years for bruce campbell to finally put his masterpiece man with the screaming brain on the screen but campbell had to alter his story by having it due to financial problems take place in sofia bulgaria not where he initially wanted it to be filmed in los angeles california in the film burce campbell plays us pharmaceutical tycoon willian cole who travels together with his spoiled rotten wife jackie antoinette byron to the former communist republic of bulgaria it s there that william wants to help finance bulgaria s almost non existent mass transportation system it s poor william s misfortune to get involved with both gypsy woman tatoya tamara gorski and her ex boyfriend yegor valdimir kolev an ex kgb taxi driver the two william yegor will unwittingly end up shearing their brains inside william s skull because of tatoya s jealousy and vindictiveness after tatoya murders both william and yegor their bodies are delivered to mad scientist dr ivan ivanowitch ivanov stacy keach by his loyal assistant pavel ted raimi to have their brains experimented with dr ivanov has this theory in that two heads are better then one and now with the material william yegor available to him dr ivanov at last is finally going to prove it what dr ivanov is going to sadly find out is that by fusing the two heads or brains together their brain waves will overlap and cause them to not only malfunction but turn against each other william with yegor s right lobe fused into his damaged brain is out to find tatoya and make her pay for the damage she caused both him and yegor yegor for his part is stuck in william s head who s likes and dislikes in both food and drink are totally opposite to his own this causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in them fighting for control of william s body things get even more screwed up when jackie finding out that tatoya murdered her husband william confront her in the dangerous and high crime section of bravoda call gypsy town and ends up being murdered herself brought back to dr ivanov by his assistant pavel it s determined with no body available to plant jackie s brain inside of an experimental robot that pavel s been working on the operation is a rousing success but the only drawback is that jackie with her brain inside the robot has to have her brain recharged every few hours or like a real brain lacking oxygen she ll die together with the robot s batteries combination 1930 s like screw ball comedy and horror flick with both william yegor turning the bulgarian town of bravoda upside down in trying to find tatoya and make her pay with her life for the sad state of existence she put them both into spoiler alert it s dr ivanov who in fact saves the day by discovering how to keep the two brains from fighting and thus cooperating with each other this is done by him instead of fusing the brains together dr ivanov keep them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall in between the two uncooperative globs of gray matter 
698,this is a comedy based on national stereotypes no doubt if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russians or brits are if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions you can have fun with this film nicole kidman is at her best sexy moving and funny ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out shadowed by nicole and the rest of the cast does good work as well the final is moving and logical movie logics of course worth watching if you accept the rules of the game 
509,in the process of boring you with the wordy rambling storyline and the complete absence of character development it manages to enforce a few negative black stereotypes out there at one point i was wondering if jesse helms co wrote the screenplay 
273,i found my tape of this long forgotten show besides the theme song disco beaver from outer space this show is barely watchable you will be flipping through channels just like the couple flipping through the tv channels this is a parody of tv the beaver is cool the homosexual dracula the chick discussing her peria experiences and the lady with the overly big lips discussing homosexuality show us everything that is wrong with tv it is all bad just like the beaver from outer space who seems to be lost in this new world you will be too out of 
403,do not avoid this movie simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious it possibly is the worst movie i have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and i were able to laugh at every single moment of this film at times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we re pretty sure that it is not characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly and the vampire assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire you will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the vampire assassin as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts to so if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh histerically then i suggest this one as long as you go in with an open mind don t expect a good movie expect the worst and it will be even worse than that i seriously want to buy this movie and place it atop my comedy movie selection right next to anchorman 
581,i m easily entertained i enjoyed hot shots and the naked gun and their many sequels even when most people found them unbearable i ve even managed to enjoy most pauly shore movies there is only one movie that i ve seen that i can honestly say was bad and this was it it s been a while since i ve seen it but i do remember sitting in the theater thinking this is a dumb movie why did i see this it s honestly the only movie that i cannot recommend 
449,it s possible that a man called sledge might have been done irreparable damage on the cutting room floor maybe someone will demand a director s cut one day but i seriously doubt it james garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in doing so brought a whole lot of americans over to fill the cast out folks like dennis weaver claude akins john marley and of course we have vic morrow who both wrote and directed this film garner always gets cast as likable rogues because he s so darn good at playing them but he has played serious and done it well in films like the children s hour and hour of the gun he can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully but a man called sledge can t be counted as one of his successes he s got the title role as luther sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head after partner tony young gets killed in a saloon and garner takes appropriate eastwood style measures he s followed from the saloon by john marley marley s spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run garner gets his gang together for a heist here s where the movie goes totally off the wall usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning certainly that was the case in the war wagon which some other reviewer cited but in this one garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake us marshal dennis weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed that was just too much to swallow if taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before but i will say for those who like the blood and guts of italian westerns during that prison break there s enough there for three movies that s not the whole thing of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends but by that time the whole film has lost a lot of coherency the great movie singer of the thirties allan jones is listed in the credits but for the life of me i can t find him in the film maybe a chorus of the donkey serenade might have made this better couldn t have hurt any 
946,one of disney s best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for 1 hour forty two minutes and after all wasn t movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast sparkles with delight magictrain
38,i enjoyed this movie a lot i thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had met cortland she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness the way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible i d recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the under laying meaning of the movie and plot 
597,investigative reporter darren mcgavin as carl kolchak is back this time he s after the night strangler once again police officials and fellow journalists either disbelieve or want to cover up the supernatural angle producer director dan curtis presents the same basic story as his preceding night with understandably less success mr curtis assembles a fun supporting cast included are dark shadows alumni george dicenzo and ivor francis jo ann pflug as louise harper heads up a sexy collection of belly dancers and although i ve never seen it mentioned anywhere that must be roger davis as mr mcgavin s dining companion in an early scene feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires the night strangler 1 16 73 dan curtis darren mcgavin jo ann pflug simon oakland wally cox
284,as a community theater actor who works hard at it but doesn t take acting too seriously i m always amused by those who treat it as great art this movie skewers the actor s craft mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughs a ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator when the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food the actor is kidnapped and forced to play the part of a lifetime by the neo nazi head of the secret service he plays it to the hilt gets the dictator s girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa and turns the tables on his captors beautifully lots of great shtick by the leads lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard and fun little cameos abound sammy davis jr makes light of himself jonathan winters plays a semi retired american businessman with something else going on and raul julia sonia braga and above all richard dreyfuss are exceptional this is a dumb movie but it has lots of beautiful locations in brazil a humorous script and good actors doing their thing and looking like they re actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only play acting 
956,the magnetism radiated from elvira drawing her legions of devoted admirers has a primordial quality with her lengthy well toned figure large bust innocuously mischievous attitude and grab bag lexicon of me generation valley slang the character of elvira has a universal and timeless appeal as an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling it is evident that the elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one liners and large chest as initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level a strange mixture of one dimensional romantic yearning boyish sexual craving and the desire for non threateningly lighthearted fun she symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town the other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons in the end however her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients the end result is that while elvira is infinitely interesting her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense fortunately i have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer best quote bob redding how s your head elvira i haven t had any complaints 
818,i find this film meretricious tentative lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid but i admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool i find the inauspiciously performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws d urville martin broke funny speaking from a film directors perspective there is times i just want to drop everything and have fun on the set this film looks like fun when other aspiring film directors ask me advice i just tell them to watch any film by rudy ray moore they always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters woody allen scorsese lucas capra i laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first 
850,enormous suspension of disbelief is required where will s genius is concerned not just in math he is also very well read in economic history able to out shrink several shrinks etc etc no no no i don t buy it while they re at it they might as well have him wearing a big s on his chest flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets among other problems real genius shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is and whether it deserves such mindless homage doesn t simply appear ex nihilo it isn t ever so multi faceted and it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries better to have made will a basketball prodigy except that damon s too short 
107,i am a big fan of horror movies and know a lot of info on serial killers obviously the director of this one refused to research the film he was creating because half of the movie was fictional more than that the character of ed gein was portrayed in the wrong light i did not rent the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend erica i rented it to watch ed gein and his legendary story this movie was awful the only reason i gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the gore wasn t too bad acting horrible actors sub par movie waste of time a big upset all around but i wont give up my search for a good horror movie 
736,i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november 2005 with my boyfriend we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving it was very well directed with strong imagery the visual effects were amazing especially for a short it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard this leans towards the gothic feel i would love to see this as a full feature film carrie
585,let me start by stating that i usually do like renny harlin s directing style for the most part and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots unlike harlin s elm street 4 and die hard 2 which i really liked there is something that is missing from this movie that my friends is a script the dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity there are so many awful lines in this movie i don t even want to have to remember any of them not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure it s almost like harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said they could improve the script wrong again the sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue stallone has never been a favorite of mine but when he is acting circles around lithgow turner and the worst of the bunch rooker there is something wrong with this picture lithgow played one of the best villains in ricochet yet comes across as someone who can t act to save his life here how is that possible i ve always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by stallone who himself still phoned in his performance turner s part is so small and pointless but she still manages to appear lost on screen michael rooker can act i know this because i have witnessed it in days of thunder but he seems like he is reading his lines from cue cards has it come to this when rooker and lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking i just wanted the movie to end right there or have them both amazingly find their acting ability unfortunately neither of those things occurred which brings me back to harlin who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters it s his fault that i was never drawn into this movie at all because he should have made the people actually act the script is not very good but still the actors performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director i don t care how much was paid for the special effects which for the most part are good you still can t just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting plus the pacing of this movie seems to be off the opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all i mean i understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene but i really didn t care if they got the money or not in that scene if the bad guy s would have won early maybe i wouldn t have had to witness one of the worst movies ever 
664,what a waste of great acting talent this is a shame because with catherine deneuve mathieu amalric emmanuelle devos chiara mastroianni and melvil poupaud not to mention others less well known in america that s a lot of acting talent to waste this film by arnaud desplech was a terrible disappointment after having enjoyed his kings and queens and this film left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where i actually left before the movie ended the movie wandered around its central storyline involving catherine deneuve s illness getting sidetracked by every peripheral storyline and supporting character that appeared on screen the movie also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters disliked each other so much this was a story of family dysfunction so that the dearth of coherent narrative became even more critical finally the soundtrack which ranged from hip hop to bach to mendelhson s midsummer night s dream was at odds with the emotional temperature of the movie and further obscured any emotion the viewer should have been feeling at the time the photography the director often began scenes with a mainly dark screen where our only sight is through a small opening making feel as if we are watching through a peephole that then expands was also pretentious and inscrutable 
281,although charlie chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910 s others don t quite make it examples like his new job and shanghaied come to mind and i would also the floorwalker in this category charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store and vice versa this manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it and charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects stolen by other costumers there aren t many laughs in it except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator for the rest quite disappointing 4 10 
220,i did not see this film in the theater i confess to an anti vinnie barbarino bias who the hell was john travolta to be making movies i remember the oscar broadcast that year with travolta looking absolutely devastated when he didn t win how dare he when there were real actors in the running i m sorry john you should have won after catching this film on cable years ago i fell in love with the entire movie bud sissy uncle bob wes all wonderfully done i also confess to never passing it by when i channel surf i have to stop and watch over the years i ve learned to do most of the dialogue dance with my thumbs in my waistband and learned to appreciate travolta more the only disappointing thing to me was the oversight on the soundtrack of some of the music from urban cowboy looking for love defines the film but urban cowboy was chock full of classics that didn t make it to the soundtrack it should have been a double cd 
140,i guess this is the first time i have seen a roscoe fatty arbuckle movie i really liked him in his title role as a butcher boy the way he moves is very funny in my opinion for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette i think he is a good actor his facial expressions really suit the role he plays for example how he winks at the audience in the end but one might add that that was probably not too difficult anyway i think he would have deserved a longer career as you probably know it was ruined by greedy journalists who made money by printing false accusations that said he was involved in a scandal the plot is not very important in the first half fatty and alum are employees at a store and rivals for almondine s affection after a heavy food fight almondine is sent to a girls school by her father the store owner this is the beginning of the second half both fatty and alum enter the school in drag and the fight for almondine continues some of the characters names are different in the version that i have seen it seems that for some reason they replaced the original title cards with new ones there are a lot of corny gags like food fights and pratfalls but they are done well in my opinion and there are some gags i really liked for example how they make the dog run the pepper mill or is it a coffee mill or the scene when fatty dons a coat although it is obviously not necessary or when miss teachem the head of the girls school spanks fatty and he spanks her back buster keaton is also funny in this his first movie a good addition to the cast in the first half he is a customer at the store in the second half he supports alum in his fight for almondine i liked his acrobatics for example when fatty pushes him from one room of the school to another he doesn t show a simple pratfall but lands on his hands and his head and does a little pirouette watch out for one scene in the food fight alum throws a flour bag at him but it misses and hits the store owner instead that makes buster laugh which must be a rarity since he normally always shows a neutral expression which as you probably also know already got him the nickname the great stone face one more note al st john who plays alum was fatty arbuckle s nephew and later became famous for the role of fuzzy that he played in lots of westerns i don t like this one as much as i like for example one week and the balloonatic films that buster made later without fatty and it didn t make me laugh out loud often but it made me smile a lot so i have given it eight points 
753,troma founder lloyd kaufman is the crapkeeper in this anthology film made up of two films that were such celluloid feces that llyod tried to salvage them by combining the two into one anthology film and throwing in copious amounts of nudity whenever possible does it work nope it s still crap that i d have to scrape off my boots if i stepped in it will anyone like this mess sure young teen aged mongoloids with the combined iqs of a vienna sausage have to laugh at something i guess for those who have brains that are even semi functioning steer clear though and watch something less insulting to your intelligence even dude where s my car would do my grade f
123,gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality and to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as drama but i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years immensely sympathetic performance from jared harriss who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma hopefully without poor richards penchant for hellraising and haminess and charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer radiant location photography including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to life and making magic in the dark 
863,sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing and the best credit i can give this is that it maintains that old tradition these three tales aren t anything as good as any from the original creepshow by far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners the second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it the third story includes a cameo from stephen king as a truck driver but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him down watch the original creepshow instead or if you already have done then be happy with that 
531,i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired masiela lusha off the show simply because he discovered that she wasn t a latino emigrant but was an emigrant from albania i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired masiela lusha off the show simply because he discovered that she wasn t a latino emigrant but was an emigrant from albania i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing 
559,i m glad this was the last of the 40 s universal mummy movies the movies were all of variating qualities and this movie was definitely one of the lesser ones problem is that it s a very slow moving movie in which basically nothing interesting or exciting is ever happening perhaps it would had all been better if the mummy had made his entrance earlier on in the movie instead now the movie once again spends its first 20 minutes explaining what had all happened in the previous mummy movies by also once again using archive footage from this time the mummy from 1932 again to which this movie is the fourth mummy movie following the 1932 mummy story the movie just never knows to find the right pace and even though the movie is barely over an hour long it still feels a bit like a drag it of course also doesn t help that the movie has a rather simplistic and actually very little interesting story the movie also feels quite disjointed the first and second half of the movie don t really connect to each other and they seemed like two separate movies on their own at least lon chaney jr is still in it he once more reprises the role of the mummy kharis for the third time too bad that he has such limited screen time this time he gets unfortunately very little interesting to do which is also a big waste of the mummy character itself the movie is further more filled with dozens of silly actors who are playing around with silly accents it seemed so totally unnecessary to me that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent and it actually gets quite distracting and annoying at points the mummy movies that s least worth seeing 4 10
253,the over heated plot of bonjour tristesse is taken from a juvenile first novel by francoise sagan which became a best seller though god knows why for teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step parent it may have a certain appeal don t be taken in by the fact that david niven plays the playboy father and deborah kerr the step mother in prospect unfortunately too much rests on the frail shoulders of jean seberg she s beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager the problem is that she can strike poses but she can t act anyone who saw her as joan of arc in otto preminger s st joan seberg s first film knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film this movie also by preminger fulfills the promise of the first it was her second movie she was now 20 what was preminger thinking that niven and kerr could compensate for seberg s lack of acting capacity not a chance seberg s character is at the center of the story and pretty though she is convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old she can t meet the emotional demands of the role i don t know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures but anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check in spite of niven and kerr this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons 
134,early talkie feature based on a popular stage play a murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a s√©ance to see who the murderer is while the lights are out there s another murder so it s someone in that room what follows is an obvious dull and creaky murder mystery most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree they act like they re on stage where you have to overdo things and it looks silly on screen most embarrassing is bela lugosi two years before dracula who really overdoes it as a police inspector static direction by tod browning who was always overrated doesn t help for browning and lugosi completists only i give it a 3 
364,i purchased this film for 5 in a bargain bin at my local video store for one reason only chase masterson but i should have crumbled up the five thrown it in a toilet and flushed the film is about a bunch of twenty somethings that peaked in high school and reunite on the anniversary of their idiot friends death who got drunk and wandered into the woods and died there problem is a reptilian monster is hunting them down one by one the acting is abysmal these worthless people were apparently cast offs on shows like 90210 and dawsons creek the directing was on par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old the entire set looks like someone s backyard in malibu the people on here that have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and or actors avoid this pile of garbage at all costs 
49,the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada lee and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen james wong howe this remake is abominable in spite of the presence of rod steiger joe mantegna and jennifer beals there is nothing of value here and it is a shame this product bears the same title as the brilliant original only the main character s name charlie davis is the same in both films i don t think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake i am amazed that rod steiger participated this may be the only bad film he ever made maybe he needed the paycheck 
933,i ll start with what i liked i really liked the songs everything about them was great the costumes music lyrics as long as the translation was good choreography everything i loved the crab scene and the cooking scene but that s about it i get it arty cinema blablabla but too much is too much too much silence it was interesting for an hour but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time really too much boredom no movie should ever be boring no matter how deep it was to be too much porn like scenes i do get it really i get that they were filming a porn movie there but really really really that is too much i truly think that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way 3 stars for the songs :)
860,this one features an interesting way of handling a camera espercially for a dtv movie the version i saw was full screen but it falls short on the scenario department first you getaround 20mn of talk talk talk in a would be hip post trainspotting way then it s slasher city and then comesthe most dishonest cheat ending i ve seen much worse than april fool s day where at least it made sense so all inall it s the old song and dance interesting director trieshard but deserves better movie funny usually it is the actors which are in desperate need ofsomething better skip it anyway for your time
366,well i have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film natalie portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother daughter relationship film beautiful film 
668,this must be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen on a par with blair witch and just as annoying the flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and i think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying i think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something she can really hear something one of these guys must have at least seen scream where they draw your attention to such things it is also a big let down when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script so sorry folks i got this on weekly at the video shop and i would still like my money back 
899,there s one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans everyone else this is just a very bad horror flick the female characters are typical horror movies females they are wooden annoying and dumb you are glad when they are killed off long live the strong female character in a horror movie 
266,this was the first ewan mcgregor movie i ever saw outside of star wars since then i have become a very big ewan mcgregor fan but i still can t bring myself to forgive this movie s existence my sister has always been a huge jane austen fan and because of that i have been subjected to various of the classics emma being one of them i ve always considered them irritating stupid and boring however after watching this terrible rendition i was forced to admit that the original emma was delightful and charming ewan mcgregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of frank churchill gweneth paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid my recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in english period drama go see the originals if you re a ewan mcgregor fan believe me by skipping this film you haven t missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut 
642, the seven ups seems like a replay of the french connection which was released two years prior both the late roy scheider and tony lo bianco make appearances as well as stunt driver bill hickman but we aren t dealing with french drug baddies instead we are dealing with a war against assorted hoods and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a hoodlum we get to see unpleasantness and a pre 1990s new york city i love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action and it is a reminder of a cooler time that said when one compares the car chases mr hickman had involvement in the three most compared this movie bullitt and the french connection each chase scene has its own qualities and this one is simply superb and i am glad this title has seen the light of day on dvd 
906,greenthumb grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja growing in order to pay the bills it sounds promising and the ever reliable brenda blethyn doesn t disappoint but the material is sitcom thin there s actually a scene where grace asks her young gardener to give me one a toke and he thinks she s asking for sex and acts all awkward yes it s humour so twee a nun would be bored saving grace doesn t seem to know what it wants to be the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of ryan s daughter whilst the light hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of antiques roadshow it does speed up after the first hour but by then it s too clich√©d to care the climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless deux ex machina i ve ever seen 
805,who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money i hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring d lister actors and a storyline so similar to the 1st one i found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to wild things 2 and death to the supermodels for 2 99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one whoever thought that this straight to video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because i think what pretty much most of the people who ve seen this film thinks what a load of crap 
634,what we ve got here is a situation a man is found to be in distress and people want to help him in contrasting ways at the end they are forced to let it go you can t fix people and though in various aspects reign over me is conventionally hollywood that message isn t this story is not about charlie fineman adam sandler a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9 11 plane who s gone into a nearly psychotic state of ptss since it s about what meeting charlie does to alan johnson don cheadle a dentist in new york who was his roommate in dental school and knowing about his tragedy spots him on the street and reconnects charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating manhattan traffic with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair the hair is sandler s chief prop to show he s deranged and the use of music as an escape must hit home to every ipod wielding subway rider charlie is a disaster but paradoxically alan stuck with a controlling wife jada pinkett smith soon begins to envy him charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund insurance money from the tragedy and starts dragging alan off to hang out eat chinese buy records or watch a mel brooks marathon at a rep house charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady redoing the kitchen over and over collecting old vinyl of springsteen the who etc and playing a video game called shadow of the collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room charlie s in laws are deeply concerned about him but also somehow resentful as we learn later alan has a new patient who is propositioning him charlie s desperation makes us see alan s trying to help charlie partly permits alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them cheadle and sandler make an odd couple but that doesn t matter because it s convincing that they might both need each other charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family because to escape his loss he is pretending he never had one and so what if as a roommate charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste no motown alan wants an escape from his tidy emasculating life he s under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners who lord it over him though it s he who set up the practice they re white by the way and he s black there s also the lascivious patient from hell who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices but starts looking different when charlie comes by and notices she s a babe his libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute he s also drawn to the breasts of liv tyler a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat charlie when he admits he might need help sandler s mad scenes are a little too theatrical as are a lot of the plot devices in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching charlie s not just delusional and sad but dangerous and violent and all these efforts to help him start to backfire the movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people can t be made right this is an interesting movie sometimes a touching one and it s the first time 9 11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering but there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times many of the people are too broadly drawn and the overly grand hollywood interiors have dreadful d√©cor only the manhattan streets look real there s a courtroom scene that is preposterous and donald sutherland is a judge who s too good to be true alan s family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call and yet this is worth watching for the acting the control and subtlety of cheadle and sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in p t anderson s 2002 punch drunk love though that s clearly a better movie in fact a much better one

171,david zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce yes it s a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts the film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you ll likely miss them like his previous efforts which include airplane top secret and naked gun the humor flies out almost every second there are so many moments that work it s easy to overlook the few that fall flat what sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line while others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies take mafia please this film tells a new story with likable characters it touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies even for people who don t care for south park its creators matt stone and trey parker make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry the film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes sports announcers and other celebrities especially a hilarious bit with robert stack of unsolved mysteries by the way stay through the credits for a final joke with bob costas and al michaels all in all zucker has achieved in words perhaps applying to the movie s mix of sports a home dunk 
904,i really think that this movie is great personally but in every movie there is a downer now some of you may not have watched hilary duff s raise your voice but if you think about it those two shows are very very similar if you know what i mean in brave new girl holly wants so bad to get into haverty conservatory in raise your voice terri wants to go to a conservatory in l a don t remember the name of the conservatory there they are both in the music field and they both have to sing at the ending of the semester it s really funny how these two films are alike i personally like brave new girl better than raise your voice though 
770,ali g was funny at first his interviews were fresh and original the idea of a mock gangster wearing ott clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing at first but this film is just a rehash of old jokes the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part the film claimed good actors like charles dance but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2 d characters it is not terrible but isn t really funny at all a second time it could be said that the movie was ali g s last bastion of comedy after that he ran out of steam 
417,watching this again after a gap of many years and remembering the flop it was upon its original release i am surprised at how well it has held up one of the reasons for its failure was that one generation just thought it was over indulgent crap and a younger one was disappointed that it did not show the full hippy glory seen now it is clear that antonioni was already aware of and fascinated by the heady mix of fervent enthusiasm for change and a lack of any clear vision for the future the lead pair are excellent and it is shameful that they took so much flak for the film s perceived failure they are ideal and convey perfectly the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure delight in lovemaking i blame others for the over emphasis on the student revolt sequences at the start but have to say that from there on in this is one of the directors most beautiful looking pictures and he certainly got the very best out of the man made and natural landscapes oh and i haven t even mentioned the highly explosive ending 
661,wow i m a huge henry viii tudor era fan and well this was interesting the only one i watched was the catherine of aragon one and wow just wow i ve seen bad acting before but this reached new heights when the actress who played catherine was umm crying she wails and screams and i have to admit i rewinded many times many many times funny funny stuff the only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent was the actress playing anne boleyn i might be prejudiced though i do have a slight obsession with anne boleyn she was a really facinating woman read up on her it s worth it also i have read a lot about the tudor time period and i think that the characters weren t very acurately displayed they were all very stereotypical only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock 
777,very violent and nicely filmed movie paulina is a bad sexy girl who will show that men can be raped too this movie has lots of black humor this guy will kill anybody just to forget he used to be a gangster there will be sometimes when you wouldn t know whether to shiver or to smile and think am i laughing at someone who is killing people 
856,i have to admit that in spite of all media promotion and being nominee for oscar my expectation from the film was not so high before watching it and i really found what i expected a film trying to be likable for both for conservatives and liberals in turkey trying being authentic for foreign spectators and enough funny for all but it should be understood that it is not possible to be favorable for everybody therefore film stays as average for all whole movie is telling a story occurred within 24 hours to fit the short story in a full movie length some scenes are added without a connection with the main story these are mostly the ice cream selling scenes to the eccentric local people i e goat herdsman old women etc and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the spectators by skits with comic dialogs the subject is mentioned as a universal problem struggle of a local producer tradesman against holding companies and monopoly but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before most of the readers will remember the hero grocer against supermarket from ferhan sensoy in 1980 s this was the correct story at correct time shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now except some gibbers due to local accent the performance of cast is so successful the leading role is played by turan ozdemir with excessive body language but anyway he is successful too on the other hand against limited budget appreciable efforts of director and players are obviously giving a good mood to the film but this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with italian neo realists or worth to be oscar nominee note in the real life normally the ice cream seller would stop his own production and be the dealer of one of the competitors of manda brand 
203,i caught 2 37 at the afi fest in los angeles it s a very well shot first film though the dv format begins to show itself in outside scenes and i m sure it has good intentions of showing us the dark side of high school in other words every side of high school but the filmmaker doesn t have the talent to write or direct up to the premise s promise there are several characters but none of them are any more than what the plot requires them to be there s no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of i am troubled teen x i have y problem the perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally troublesome let s start with the men you have the stoner kid who s gay the jock who s also gay the boy who rapes his sister and mr peepants as the stereotype requires all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent toward women and themselves naturally or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes the two gay male characters beat up women peepants and themselves i d be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads or if the characters somehow transcended them yet neither took place and that s all there is to these characters stories next the ladies one young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife another is the pregnant rapee of the sister raping brother and there s the girl who kills herself i ll get to that later again i don t think there s a requirement of political correctness for filmmakers i d be out of a job were that the case but i do think that it s only justified if there s more to that character or story if that archetype were being used to reveal something about character other than i m a teenager and life sucks i d be happy as a clam but nothing new is revealed nothing is subverted or changed or sublimated finally the girl who kills herself this is blunt and highly sloppy storytelling we re supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who we ve seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film we ve followed all these other stories for an hour and a half and now we re invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn t part of the story it s cheap exploitative and sloppy despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this you have to earn something like that you can t simply purchase it on credit so this suicide happens we get wrap ups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down and the film ends what have i learned i already knew high school sucked been there done that i already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women i already knew that kids with disabilities are mocked what else is there then smoke mirrors and some really nice views of leaves oh and the nastiest deus ex machina i ve seen in a while 
1,some may go for a film like this but i most assuredly did not a college professor david norwell suddenly gets a yen for adoption he pretty much takes the first child offered a bad choice named adam as it turns out adam doesn t have both oars in the water which almost immediately causes untold stress and turmoil for dr norwell this sob story drolly played out with one problem after another all centered around adam s inabilities and seizures why norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out personally i think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack bypass this yawner 
538,this italian semi horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes the only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film the story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon go berserk and seemingly kill them they show the nudity but they never really show the murders at this point in the film then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her he has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife evelyn was also one she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience s business after a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes foxes and such at this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely this movie just did not work for me it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film explaining evelyn s death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where evelyn did rise from the grave granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave just not under her own power the gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too i just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull 
299,a wonderful film in the best scandinavian eldritch magic tradition with very far sighted analysis of much of the big issues we are just starting to face should be compulsory viewing for all politicians take your pick from privacy nuclear sustainability global climate change quality of life reminiscent of thoreaus walden but with modern twist and considerable humour i m not finnish although i ve travelled there and have good finnish friends but i found it totally accessible and also culturally informative 
811,i am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5 2 10 for what affects me it is definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i still keep wondering why i watched it until the end first of all the plot is totally hopeless and the acting truly awful i think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than susan lucci concerning mr kamar del s reyes i think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his valley of the dolls to sum up it is total waste of time and i m trying to stay polite to avoid at any cost my rating is 1 and i still think it is well paid but since we cannot give a o 
277,it seems that there is great potential for the story line of this film to be something worth watching the acting was flat and the story lacked depth there was too much reliance on camera work which had some high points i have to agree with the other negative comments i only wish i had read them before buying the dvd the film may be worth watching for free and you are bored to tears before hand there could have been a lot more plot development with why there are homeless in moscow i e post soviet capitalism rampant drug usage i e increased heroin trafficking from afghanistan more development of why the resurgence of russian orthodoxy after the fall of the u s s r the archaeologists themselves or even more into the struggle against nihilism 
827,before i start let me say that i fully believe in god i believe in heaven and in hell kay now that thats out of the way i just wanna say that what in the world do these morons that call themselves hosts think they are doing the last time i checked a host doesn t discriminate spew hatred filled rants on tv or try to shove their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that ventures onto the channel all of these that crazy idiotic conservitive bible thumping fred phelps lover pat robertson does daily i am all for free speech but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture off his ideal way of life you are right away sent to hell this is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of soooo many problems one day in my class room we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch some tv since the teach didn t give us any work and we against many of us s will watched 700 s club and of course that jerk pat was on ranting and raving about the bible and he said simon along the lines of god says homosexuality is a sin and i actually heard a kid go hmm i guess he s right wtf seriously if the host is trying to make people think that someone else s sexual orientation is a huge sin then they seriously need to take that host duct tape them and throw them off of a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic 
448,the plot in petites coupures certainly left this viewer dumbfounded spoiler in the space of 48hrs or so auteuil s character has an affair with a teenager loses his wife s affections attempts to seduce scott thomas is rejected by her goes on to grope yet another female character in the back of a car and then is finally shot for his trouble end of spoiler wha the only saving grace in this flick is kristin scott thomas similar to charlotte rampling she seems a natural to star in french cinema my hope is that one day fran√ßois ozon may cast her in a part where she can show her true talent there are some fine french films such as the remarkable le colonel chabert begging for a dvd release yet this is the tripe that gets chosen avoid this one zzzz 
647,caddyshack ii is nothing compared to the original caddyshack but there are legitimate reasons for it 1 rodney dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film but he didn t like the script wanted to change it his request was denied so he didn t do the film 2 it was low budget bill murray had grown to superstar status ted knight passed away in 1986 and chevy chase the so called ace of the first movie although it was rodney all the way couldn t t be on more than 5 minutes because it would cost too much to pay him but you had dan aykroyd robert stack randy quaid and jackie mason all serviceable substitutes who none had their best performances 
186,this game is one of the best rpg fist it is actually more amusing than any other because of the battle system you harm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack you can transform into dragoon the special attack the magic the script is very good characters are all lovely and you have no long dialogs to support as happened in several games of final fintasy series i got bored of that dialogs about past when you just want to go on with the game s story ambientation is a jewel on this game it combines middle age fantasy with futuristic science fiction it s remarkable that animation effects are just incredible i like them more than other in other modern games we can t remember that legend of the dragoon is 8 years now then map is huge there are all kinds of places an enemies finally music is not the best game muse i have heard but it s perfect for a game like this 
707,i have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago being made almost 30 years ago i thought the scary moments would be rather tame boy was i wrong there are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine even the acting was great jamie lee curtis was fantastic and donald pleasance was superb on the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it it makes all the copycats e g nightmare on elm street scream look very tame i can t really say it is carpenter s best because i have not seen many of his the only one i can remember of his is starman i think he made it halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre 
290,this is the second animatrix short and the first of them to be what one could call artistic it contains a lot of references metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material especially with a running time of 9 minutes i ve heard some complaints that this is anti human or tries to direct hate towards man for their sins against machine i don t think that s true it merely uses the robots to show us that as humans we aren t particularly accepting or open minded towards anyone different from ourselves i d say it does a great job of that the plot is good it plays as a historical document recounting what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like the voice acting is very good if there is not a lot of it the animation is nice and the use of color in spite of the usually realistic drawing style makes it more open to do the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery this has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals as well as a little nudity the disc holds a commentary not in english but subtitled and worth a listen read there is also a well done and informative making of based on both parts so i would advise watching it after seeing the next one as well i recommend this to anyone who enjoys the matrix universe and or science fiction in general 8 10
978,made with film stock left over from the production of nana 1927 s sur un air de charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned and that s the best way to view it jean renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together the plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post holocaust paris where a white native girl teaches him the charleston naturally he assumes she s a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of white aborigine music there are plenty of surreal touches be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in catherine hessling s hair the angels the girl telephones renoir and producer pierre braunberger among them or the fact that black performer johnny huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while hessling s dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion but there s not really enough to sustain it for two reels an additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on lions gate s new dvd 
576,disappointing and irritating the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clich√©s in a disjointed fashion character is not explored in depth these are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element the mother s affair with her daughter s lover anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye the script portrays darren daniel craig as a dr jekyll mr hyde without any hints about why except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic 
201,entertainment tonight has been going down hill for the last few years but as of last night aug 17th 2006 they reached a new low in an effort to try to hype up their broadcast they decided to post actual photos of jonbenet ramsey s body in their teasers last night saying pictures from the case you have never seen before the two photos were graphic and very disturbing one was of the side of her face and head neck and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck and bruising on her face this was so hideously awful i could not believe it how has this got to do with anything remotely related to hollywood entertainment nothing they have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new low and it shows this used to be the premiere show to watch and it s just garbage now i will watch access hollywood from now on 
949,i went to see this film out of curiosity and to settle an argument the film is now best known from the suite of music sergei prokofiev extracted from his incidental music to the film the troika movement even turning up in pop arrangements the general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings a clerk accidentally generates a non existent lieutenant kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar the tsar is interested in this person and rather than tell him he doesn t exist the courtiers and officers maintain the pretence that he is real kizhe is exiled to siberia recalled promoted married promoted again dies is given a state funeral revealed as an embezzler and posthumously demoted to the ranks i had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented kizhe involving ink blots and sneezes but i d heard the film was lost so there was no way to find out what happens then the film turned up at the barbican in london as part of their prokofiev festival for the record it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words whilst writing an order and turns kuzhe into kizhe as the tsar is in a hurry to see the order there s no time to correct the mistake having gone expecting an historical curiosity i was pleasantly surprised the film is very funny and the audience myself included laughed continuously although most of it is filmed straight set mostly in the palace there are a few trick shots where multiple images appear on the screen for instance the tsar s army is represented by a small group repeated across the screen four identical guards perform perfect drill in perfect unison two identical servants scrub the floor one slight drawback was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was there were two women who might have been the tsar s daughters or a daughter and a servant or something else and very few people were named but all in all an enjoyable film and i m surprised it s not seen more often 
99,this film is one of the best memories i have from childhood having always loved tigers my mum took me to see it it is absolutely amazing its is one of those films that leaves a lasting impression on you the image of tigers running through the snow with it all spraying around is still in my head some 25 yrs on not many films have managed that as other comments have said photography is stunning a must see i have also been looking for the film for some time with no luck at all checking amazon every now and then reveals nothing not even listed if anyone does know of a source please contact me or post here tim:(
339,29 sept 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror flicks this was the date that bbc1 broadcast for the only time i m aware of jeff lieberman s super creepy 1981 shocker just before dawn and it made a huge impression on me nearly twenty years later i m delighted to report that i ve finally got my hands on the two disc shriek show media blasters special edition and it s just as eerie and unsettling as i remember it if not more so the plot as is usual for genre flicks and this was lieberman s first film as a director for hire though he did at least remove all the religious cult snake handling mumbo jumbo from the screenplay is a bit thin five likable twenty somethings including chris lemmon son of jack in a pair of uncomfortably tight white strides venture into the dense oregon woodlands to do a spot of camping and to check out a patch of land that s been bequeathed to one of their number but just before dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because lieberman wastes no time in showing us just how deranged things are on this particular patch of mountain with a complete innocent skewered and a drunk preacher s truck shoved down a hill and engulfed in flames within minutes of the film beginning the youngsters come rolling into the picture in a snappy winnebago blondie s heart of glass pounding on the soundtrack and before you can say texas chainsaw massacre they ve clobbered an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggro from the heavy set maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes forest ranger roy george kennedy warns them that things are likely to go awry if they go any further but they go ahead with the trip anyway refusing to give the sozzled preacher a ride even though he s understandably scared witless and finally pitching camp miles from anywhere needless to say things go downhill from here although this film s not short on bloody horror and well handled action scenes the standout moments for me are those where lieberman lets his camera zoom out long and slow from apparently innocuous shots of the fun loving kids larking around in the wilderness or just lets it settle for a while on the dense imposing people dwarfing woodlands he makes the oregon exteriors as threatening and as ominous as kubrick made the overlook hotel s spacious interiors in the shining and brad fiedel s score discounting the horribly distorted racket that runs over the titles stays the right side of intrusive underscoring the slowly escalating menace with subtlety and flair there are plenty of surprises along the way nods to deliverance with the discovery of a backwoods babe and her freaky disturbing family and a truly bizarre kill technique deployed shortly before the film s end i won t spoil it for you i ve said enough quite why this undervalued horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult item instead of a breakout hit is hard to ascertain but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come it deserves to be 
489, warning minor spoilers i ran into this one partway through and watched from there not knowing what it was or what the plot was it certainly held my attention i didn t know until the ending that it was based on a true story the guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl i have to question how true to life that portrayal is anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can t be entirely nice still i did have some sympathy for him as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clear my main complaint is with the ending here comes the biggest spoiler skip this paragraph if you don t want to learn it a few minutes before it ended there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered the way it got discovered was in a sting operation but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it the movie didn t show us that and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn t have been there we would already have known what the scene was about and what was going on with brad in it otherwise this is a pretty good film i give it 7 10 it made me think now i m interested to find out the facts of the real case one more thing the movie was done in 1996 some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie p s meadow sisto is lovely i hadn t seen her before she can act a little too always a plus in her line of work lol 
631,i saw this movie once a long time ago and i have no desire to ever see it again this movie is about preston waters a hard lucked preteen who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash all this changes when a bank robber runs over preston s bike and passes him a blank check as compensation preston uses the check to withdraw 1 million from the bank ironically the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check preston then buys a mansion and says that he s working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named mr macintosh named after his computer after that he just goes crazy with the money on paper this sounds like a great idea however on screen it is one of the emptiest movies i ve ever seen for one thing it s too unbelievable i know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible but i draw the line at a twelve year old boy going out with a thirty year old woman and being put in charge of a imaginary person s small fortune also this was a shallow movie with weak acting a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable the characters were either cheesy over the top annoying or underdeveloped but juice was a funny character if you re looking for a good movie to watch with your family skip this one 
958,this western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by western union while nice guy dean jagger sporting lots of hair did his best to get this done there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons so it s up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the day this is certainly one of the better 1940s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an 8 it was that good however for the life of me i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this film after all he knew nothing about westerns his forte was drama and i guess this movie is a drama of sorts just set in the old west strange yes but it seemed to work out okay though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job as for the rest of the film it s exceptional with vivid color great location shooting and very good acting as usual randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance i was surprised though with robert young being also cast in the film but it was a good casting decision he was supposed to be a harvard educated easterner when i saw barton maclane was also in the film i pretty much assumed he d be the baddie and my thoughts were well founded since he made a career out of playing jerks as for the script it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part but the final showdown between scott and barton maclane was a lot better than i d hoped making this movie ending on a very high note

221,don t let the title trick you into watching this movie i read the title saw that it came on in the middle of the night and figured it was one of those soft porn movies this movie is bad if you like soft porn movies then i m sorry to say this isn t one there are a lot of sex but nothing shown and they only last for 5 seconds or so 
675,while i do not think this was a perfect 10 i do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it s rated here no brokedown palace was not perfect and yes it s plot has been done many times before that doesn t mean it shouldn t be done again if it is done well and i think this movie had some strong moments the acting of claire danes as already mentioned many times was flawless as was kate beckinsell and i think bill pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances pullman s wife the crooked cop skip or trip or whatever his name is the cinematography was also beautifully filmed there was a lot that s good to this movie even if there were some negatives three major ones that i found as well here is what i didn t like about it the friendship between the girls in fact the girls own individual personalities were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic it would not have been improbable to lose interest before then because despite the positives more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much jumping around without the character and scene development i think would have been appropriate for this type of film that however is not my major problem and warning spoiler alert the ending as mentioned dozens of times already was awful it was awful in two respects firstly even though it would have been predictable and very hollywood i wanted a happy ending yes it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this there is a sense that justice will be served and i did sit through it to see that i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or barring that at least the cop should have got what was coming to him i mean nothing happens to the bad guys they all get away with it very disturbing also i do not understand the ambiguity of the ending i understand endings that are inspired to make one think but this was not a mystery or clue type movie we were watching and i would have liked to know something about what actually happened who was guilty etc with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since i somehow doubt there will be a sequel i did not want to be kept guessing still there was a lot to like about this movie and the acting is definitely at the top of the list i would rate this a 7 5 and say it is definitely worth a look 
494,i ve seen this movie a few times and with each viewing i still feel the excitement of embarking on a journey and the frustration of trying to overcome the barriers that impede the path it s more than a mere desire of finding home it s about the very basic human spirit of finding one s way in the world of overcoming despair of facing the character foibles that deter our goals underlying these human endeavors is the challenge to reconsider the origin of life while this film is imbued with serious ideas it has just enough comedic lines to leave the viewers hopeful it is surprisingly funny the execution of the story line is excellent this is all packaged with visually engaging animation a must see 
834,film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living only living staying alive in a cruel world a nightmare world we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it to see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else they the children of the movie are desensitized they are more than desensitized by what is around them they see sex as an act like they are watching a tv program when the one boy is with the hooker pixote is sitting on the bed watching with a blank stare no feeling he wants to be a little boy and have a family but the hooker has no compassion either and pushes him away a human film with human relations and moral judgement in a ugly scared cruel world reminds us that life is not fair but you can still have a human connection 
540,the gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 now the daughter is 16 in season 1 and they live like sisters sharing everything trusting each other completely i like the gilmore girls but i am not sure why the mother named lorelai lauren graham and the daughter named rory short for lorelai played by alexis bledel are both very beautiful women they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways there are some funny supporting characters such as luke scott patterson he and lorelai like each may be even love each other but neither of them really acts on it they have their little moments there are some other supporting characters most of them very funny and with their won touching moments what i like the most i think is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult the dialogue between them is quick sharp funny and sometimes touching as well the band they have is beautiful the gilmore girls makes you feel good so try it 
820,stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack and soon enough ollie cracks with all the horn noises he is resting at home with stan by his side needing quiet and the doctor james finlayson phones to say he is coming over to check on ollie after realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross eyed repairman the doctor comes in for a check up and after some tests he recommends drinking goat s milk and getting some sea air on the ocean after stan practises some trumpet playing hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash he and ollie to a dock to rent a boat they keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat and stan has brought his trumpet meanwhile the newspaper s front page reads that killer nick grainger escaped convict richard cramer has escaped and he sneaks onto the boys boat while they are sleeping and the goat chews through the boat rope drifting out to sea in the morning the see their location and the killer comes out demanding something to eat and he spots stan and ollie making fake food e g string for spaghetti soap for cheese belt for bacon sponge for meatballs and he forces them to eat it when ollie starts choking on something stan blows his trumpet to help and ollie s rage gets him punching the killer and it keeps going till the police arrive only to have ollie s rage get them put in prison too there were the tiniest moments of comedy but it isn t a great black and white film well here s another nice mess you ve gotten me into was number 60 on 100 years 100 quotes and stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians comedian okay 
229,wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge an ace mountain rescue climber gabriel walker stallone comes back for his girlfriend jessie janine turner while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening a spectacularly precarious mid air hijacking goes wrong and 100 million taken from a treasury department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing stranded off the snowy peaks and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash the high trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit unfortunately gab and hall michael rooker have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic john lithgow are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money with breathtaking shots vertiginous scenery dizzying heights perilous climbs freezing temperatures cliffhanger is definitely stallone s best action adventure movie 
938,oh it s an excellent piece of work to be sure in fact several of the best scenes in cinema or at least in bergman s cinema are to be found in this film liv ullmann and max von sydow are as good as you would expect do these two give bad performances sven nykvist delivers some masterful although unconventionally masterful cinematography the script is quite good especially in individual scenes sometimes the film lags and the pace is uneven though probably intentionally so what s the problem well the film is too bleak for its own good other bergman films are similarly bleak but nowhere near this harsh eventually i just gave up and i started to become a little irritated i was greatly affected often during the film but by the end i felt uninvolved it s a great film but i doubt i d ever watch it again nor suggest it to friends or if i did suggest it i d be very sure to warn them of what s ahead 8 10 
39,scary movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films for there is not much of a plot bad acting pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes but and this is a big but there is one good actor one good recurring joke and a good beginning the good actor being tim curry the one good recurring joke is the creepy weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things and the good beginning is the spoof of the excorsist the plot to scary movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion but will they survive the night this film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it 
828,dragon hunters has to be the best looking animated film i ve ever seen it was jaw dropping the film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash their weird furry blue dog that pees fire and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world gobbler an impossibly immense dragon but honestly it doesn t even matter what the film is about because it is jaw droppingly gorgeous the gravity in this fantasy world is different so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike and there are forests of floating lily pads the world is so creative so uniquely beautiful with a sort of muted storybook look to it the world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings the monsters are visually stunning as well like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats some of the plot isn t too original like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la of mice and men and never seem to be able to make it in the world but the gorgeous graphics some seriously sinister scenes and emotion evoking dialog makes this film spectacular 
470,this is really a great unknown movie perfect dialogue without the typical clich√©s this movie relied on the actor s talent and it was pulled off it even had a little bit a comedy in it but it wasn t overdone once in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to be not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in i especially loved the interracial aspects of it all now onto the actors themselves laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal it s a shame that he s only allowed to show his talent in his own movie titus welliver was fabulous as fishburne s junky half brother eamonn walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film paul calderon was perfect as a grease monkey drug lord i loved his acting since king of new york but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul chan who were paired perfectly as two of calderon s henchmen once in the life is for sure a keeper 1 2 out of 
519,the student nurses is not a typical sexploitation movie sure the nudity and sexual openness is there but it s not all for laughs stephanie rothman scripted a socially compelling well written tits ass movie which confronts the topics of racism socio economic inequalities rape abortion medical ethics public health issues human rights the vietnam war free love lsd and drug experimentation four sexy college roommates are taking their nursing internships at the same time sharon elaine giftos is assigned to the terminal care ward lynn brioni farrell to public health administration priscilla barbara leigh to gynecology and phred karen carlson to psychiatry these four beauties have ample opportunities to disrobe and fornicate of which they take advantage much to the delight of male viewers these are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution after all and are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful visceral yet low budget action sequences are interspersed throughout there s a very bloody gunfight at the resistance movement headquarters in which two policemen are shot and killed along with several members of the group an anti vietnam war protest consisting of spookily dressed young people of all races painted like skeletons becomes violent with cops beating protesters the effective trip sequence on the beach consists of beautiful weird and confusing sensory and memory montages with hyper sensual overtones in short the student nurses is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times expressed through real women s perspectives since it was written and directed by a woman but it s still fun and titillating despite its sobering treatment of subject matter 
456,with david arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie well it is a stupid movie with a horrid script but the f x namely the eight legged freaks makes this flick a hoot to watch a tribute albeit on the silly side to those great mutant creature features of the 50s arquette and sheriff sam kari wuhrer summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in arizona also in the cast are doug e doug rick overton leon rippy and the charming scarlett johansson 
772,this is truly a funny movie his dance scene done with the tape is one of the funniest scenes i can recall i thought the i am gay scene at the high school graduation ceremony a bit surrealistic though it was funny while watching it for the third time i started to pick up on a little small segments that i had missed one was when matt dillon s girl friend a classic ditz tried to use a dial phone which she had never used before kevin klein made this film successful along tom selleck this was also the first time i could appreciate debbie reynolds she proved that she can be funny she confirmed this in the tv series will and grace one discovery that i found after the third viewing is lauren ambrose of 6 feet under fame she sticks out with her red bangs but it is obvious that this is one of her first films bob newhart is also very funny at the high school principle 
970,as far as the movie goes it s an ok science fiction movie it has a lot of cool stuff in it and some quality scenes that said it s not that good and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched as for calling this another cube movie is utter and complete bullsh t this is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie the whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first but the introduction of people androids as part of the team behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch i gave this a 3 because of the backstabbing of the original this one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all watchable for those who have not seen cube hypercube but not recommendable for fans of the series 
524,after huge budget disaster films set in america like the day after tomorrow and deep impact it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale like flood using mainly unknown actors and actresses and actually focusing on england it was a welcome change of pace to seeing the empire state building being demolished however this is not a strong film on any basis whilst being fairly shocking seeing all your favourite london landmarks being demolished by a very fake cgi storm surge flood doesn t really deliver on anything else the performances are bland being saved from the pit of hell by david suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as the deputy priminister he is perhaps a little too calm for what is going on in the film all that fake water gushing around london must have made him pretty annoyed it is understandable that the effects weren t going to be as good as tdat and di but the cgi was at best average bland disappointing and sometimes even tiresome watch it if you must but watch something else straight afterwards 
719,a vastly underrated black comedy the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow baby jane reynolds and winters are mothers of young convicted murderers a nod to compulsion who run away to hide in hollywood they run a school for would be movie tots a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by awful stage moms debbie in her blonde wig i m a harlow you re more a marion davies she tells winters leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad weaver she also does a deliciously funny tango and over all gives an outstanding performance unlike anything she d done before the atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie it looks wonderful with great period detail 30 s lots of lovely swipes at hollywood and the terrifying movie tot micheal macliammoir has a ball as the drama coach hamilton starr he purrs two r s but prophetic nonetheless see it and love it 
319,i loved this movie so worth the long running time i need help with the ending though spoiler the final shot of marie at the end is this to suggest that she is still searching for renaud or possibly that she was the one who wanted to reinvigorate the 13 she seemed to be the one who delivered the initial letter to colin in the first place i don t quite understand it but i know i really liked it so if anyone has seen this and remembers it or has just seen it please elaborate on the ending thanks
412,this as the first of the ma and pa kettle flicks marjorie main ma steals the show in anything she does funny to see ida moore as emily the daffy old lady on the train god she was always old she was in desk set and alfred hitchcock presents their new house is also a co star here its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that pa doesn t care for love the painting gag keep an eye out for tom he starred in nanny the professor unfortunately he died real young oddly enough his last role was on the series death cruise weird directed by charles lamont who not only directed several of the kettle films he also did a bunch of the abbott and costello flicks so he must have known a thing or two about comedy fun story plain simple humor even the release date was april fool s day 1949 the story starts out by showing us what backward and country folk they are the neighbors are even native americans but as the story progresses we have sympathy and respect for them 
480,i saw this at the screening at gencon in indy i had some time to kill and decided to check it out it played to about 1000 people in a packed standing room only ballroom wow what a ride the script was tight the action tense the pacing perfect the character exposition excellent one thing i really appreciated was that you knew going in that this wasn t a big budget film yet it soon became obvious that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as they could despite their limitations and it was more than enough it s true that this film was targeted at a certain audience gamers tabletop players the creators make no effort to hide that but other filmmakers could learn a lot from them for in going for the jugular in scene after scene and not worrying about if mom who happens to be watching will get it they got the biggest laughs time and time again but there s enough universality there that mom will be laughing too even if she s not in on every joke i think too many times i see films that try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator so that they will appeal to the most people but the movie just ends up suffering for it but not this flick indeed this film was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around it s finger from the opening credits and while the viewers around me really wanted to like the film they weren t pushovers gamers can be among the most critical niche out there i m so glad i got to see this in a big crowd at least 10 times the audience was having such a good time that they erupted into applause at a joke or scene during the film how often does that happen at screenings it should be no surprise that there was a huge standing ovation when the closing credits rolled for my own part i can t wait for this to be released after it ended one of the producers said they were shooting for a simultaneous tv dvd release that date cannot come soon enough 
699,how disney can you get preppy rich girls act like idiots buy a bunch of stuff and get taught a lesson is disney trying to send a lesson to itself that maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human whatever the psycho analysis this movie sucked the girls want a rich party for their rich lives but then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant yes milk going to employ the workers they keep it afloat until daddy comes home and the man at the beginning who appears to be the one that takes the money is the one but the ending is dumb webcam in the cayman islands huh not worth my time ever again but it is better than howl s moving castle d 
832,i went into this hoping it would be the thought provoking little gem people have reviewed this as i love indy films and expected to dig this too knowing what a hot button this topics is i expected to be really entertained maybe even see an outsiders perspective all i can say is wow if your into self torture or mutilation then maybe you ll like this personally i don t like the idea of being pee d on or cutting myself so i thought it was garbage bad script bad acting bad story bad directing bad editing i could go on i have no clue why a reviewer claimed he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10 that s misleading and ignorant voting for a movie on imdb isn t setting a precedent it just lets other people think that a garbage bomb like this is ok to watch as long as it s controversial this film is not it tries very hard to be but fails you know the movie is bad when 15 minutes into it your praying that all main characters die horrifically unfortunately they do die but not in the painful manners that would have given the viewer some justice or vindication for having watched the 2 hours of crap they just endured do yourself a favor just don t even bother i got this movie in a bargain bin at my local video store for 50 and feel ripped off 
775,there have been very few great comedy films in the history of hindi cinema andaz apna apna happens to be one of them the film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men aamir and salman who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire s daughter raveena aamir and salman khan try their best to outwit each other and woo raveena the plot thickens when paresh rawal co plan to take over all the wealth the movie is well paced and very funny rarely does one come across a hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent this is one of the few films with aamir and salman together probably the only film unfortunately it did not succeed at the box office and we might never see a film of this calibre again aamir khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film salman khan gives a very good performance as a dim wit raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl and karishma who is raveena s assistant friend is also funny paresh rawal junior ajith shakti kapoor deven verma jagdeep and tiku talsania just add to the flavour of the film all in all the best hindi comedy ever made and i wish they make more quality films like this one you will want to watch this film time and again p s for those of you who have watched this film i also suggest gol maal chupke chupke chhoti si baat naram garam hera pheri old and new etc 
61,on the 28th of december 1895 in the grand caf√© in paris film history was writing itself while louis lumi√®re showed his short films all single shots to a paying audience la sortie des usines lumi√®re was the first film to be played and i wish i was there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audience we start with closed doors of the lumi√®re factory apparently since the image seems a photograph people thought they were just going to see a slide show not something they were hoping for but then the doors open and people are streaming out heading home first a lot of women then some men and one man on a bike with a big dog when they are all out the doors close again whether this is the first film or not some say l arriv√©e d un train √† la ciotat was the first film lumi√®re recorded it is an impressive piece of early cinema being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons one simple reason it is only fifty seconds long but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here you don t get to see historical things like this every day 
537,where to start oh yea message to the bad guys when you first find the person you have been tracking in order to kill that witnessed a crime you committed don t spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away message to the victim when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing take that opportunity to run away don t sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear message to the director if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot you can t have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away time and motion doesn t work that way it would also be nice to think that a woman doesn t have to brutally kill 4 men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home 
980,want a great recipe for failure take a crappy leftist political plot add in some weak completely undeveloped characters and then throw in the worst sequences a movie has ever known let stew for a week the amount of time probably spent making this trash the result is steal this movie a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places never before conceived this movie utterly blew chunks at my face for its entire run time words cannot convey how painful it was to watch this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of this is not plan 9 from outer space this is a long boring and sad waste of time steal this movie is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen it depresses me when i realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this tripe if you can call it acting but then again when you have poor direction poor writing poor everything acting is the last thing to criticize this movie is like a huge disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it i really wish i could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers thank you robert greenwald for giving me newfound respect for every other movie i have ever seen you have shown me what is truly awful and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy and or boring 
690,the first few minutes of the bodyguard do have a campy charm it opens with crawling text from the bible the part that samuel jackson recites to his soon to be victims in pulp fiction continues with two karate school teachers in new york arguing about the eternal question of mankind who is better sonny chiba or bruce lee and then chiba appears playing himself he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand unfortunately any entertainment value intentional or unintentional soon gets crushed by the disjointed story the lack of action for long periods of time and the poor quality of any present action to keep it simple here s why the bodyguard is an unbearable movie to watch 1 you don t know what s going on 2 there are barely any fights 3 the fights that are there are short and terribly filmed sonny chiba is cool judy lee is gorgeous her face is glorious it s only for them that i give the bodyguard a 2nd star out of 10 this movie makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours 
402,good movie great story great characters i enjoyed it immensely enough to buy the dvd when it came out the real life story it purports to tell is more fascinating and engrossing than anything the fictionalizers could ever come up with my friend who is in the media business said they shouldn t show insider dealings like this it gives the business a bad name as if there are a few problems with the dvd though first the sound volume is awfully low so you have to run up the tv volume to watch it i notice that its also like that when hbo runs it so its in the original production copy second for about the first five minutes the left side of the video is cut off that is the picture is cut off about one inch short of the left side after the five minutes it fills the screen properly left to right sloppy technical production like that is very amateurish and i don t know why the director and producer let such sloppiness slide by still even with the technical flaws its an enjoyable story one of hbo s best i think 
207,considering john doe apparently inspired kyle xy s creator i was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting however i probably had too high expectations because i was quite disappointed by it first they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience in a public area so after that scene i began to worry that it was just entertainment but the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced they focused too much on john doe which made the story far less intriguing i was also slightly disappointed by dominic purcell s performance because i found he didn t make a believable john doe an other problem was the police story it really felt like d√©j√† vu and it wasn t a pleasant sensation it leads us to the worst issue in the bunch the episodic format i could already see the fillers coming one after an other so overall i was very disappointed by it and don t recommend it to anyone considering how bad it was i better understand now why the show got canceled in some way i have the impression that it missed its target developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity it s sad because there was potential like the people he met at the club the production quality was also quite good and the casting correct but i ll never know if it got better probably not because i don t plan to watch the next episode 
918,as a former erasmus student i enjoyed this film very much it was so realistic and funny it really picked up the spirit that exists among erasmus students i hope many other students will follow this experience too however i wonder if this movie is all that interesting to watch for people with no international experience but at least one of my friends who has never gone on erasmus also enjoyed it very much i give it 9 out of 10 
129,mind you it s not supposed to be but it is as a wee tot i watched this movie in the theatre being a huge wrestling and hulk hogan fan all i remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater and that i didn t really like it very much i blacked the rest out and for good reason a poor film on par with the greats like gymkata and the pumaman no holds barred is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling well maybe the stakes aren t all that high and quite frankly i feel dirty just calling these people professionals at anything and really except for the first scene there s no wrestling to speak of so i guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beating the c out of people sounds good right hulk hogan plays rip the champion of the wwf never let it be said that hulk hogan was typecast this and movies like thunder in paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents essentially he s playing himself but with a wardrobe that s more black and blue than the hulkster s red and yellow he also has this hand gesture he does it s kinda like the ozzy devil sign people make at rock concerts except you stick your thumb in the air and you curl your index finger in my friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an r try and see for yourself if that looks like an r well then mars needs women but anyway kurt fuller with his overacting detector obviously on the fritz plays a tv exec with his slightly homoerotic heart set on getting rip who s evidentally bigger than elvis on his network he won t have any of it and exits the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one but the camera and so the movie follows fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at rip he does so when he creates his brilliantly titled battle of the tough guys marketing genius this guy from the numerous hand gestures to the rather idiotic fight scenes all played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious to the overacting to the far too frequent shots of hulk in nothing but undies this movie has everything you d ever want in a dumb movie it s frivolous not too taxing on the mind violent and includes the phrase what s that smell dookie dookie a classic for all time 
590,the photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period eisenstein builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the sailor s revolt and the massacre at the town as much as the movie is a high point in the cinema it is also an example of szocialist realism by 1925 the soviet government actively used the arts including film as a means to spread the message of the revolution eisensteins portrayal of the revolt on the battleship potempkin offers the viewer insight into the message of the soviet elite marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda 
993,this film recently voted as an audience favorite at the 2005 palm springs international film festival is inspiring and moving a famous conductor forced to retire by illness returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir and finally find fulfillment in his music drawing on sweedish traits of keeping things within oneself and of the insular character of a small swedish village this film develops each of its characters well superbly directed acted and sung it brought tears to many eyes and smiles to all hopefully it will find distribution in the united states if you can see it 
263,this is one of my favorite comedies ever not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero but taken for what it s worth and not as trivializing alcoholism the movie is simply a lot of fun it tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk irresponsible 40 something bachelor named arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune but only if he marries susan chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him arthur proposes but then unwisely falls for linda a waitress and petty thief dudley moore is perfect as arthur the world s most endearing drunk whose antics are a laugh a minute admittedly moore is arthur and i agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role the ladies of the piece are also well portrayed liza minnelli sparkles as linda and her on screen chemistry with moore is great jill clayburgh plays susan the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for arthur however this film is literally made by sir john gielgud who portrays arthur s sarcastic but moral butler hobson it s obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during hobson s longtime employment hobson is arthur s best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice the most interesting relationship in this film is not arthur s romance at all but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant it s the butler you ll remember best long after the closing credits roll 
955,writer director jay andrews a k a jim wynorski serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by grade z computer generated reptiles in komodo vs cobra as generic a rip off of mysterious island meets jurassic park as you can imagine the chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects the cobra and the komodo are hilariously awful however the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims not that any of this is in the least believable clearly komodo vs cobra had a budget that so low that virtually everything non human in its looks as fake as all get out this cheesy monster epic takes place on a remote island where the u s military conducts top secret dna testing on animals the result is that gigantic komodos and cobra thrive in this tropical island paradise as the action opens the primary scientist is gobbled up by a cobra that likes to swim after we are introduced to a group of greenpeace like environmental protesters and a journalist planet one organizer jerry ryan ryan mctavish of hellbent pays charter boat skipper jim stoddard michael pare of cbs tv s houston knights five grand with the promise of another five grand if he will take them to this forbidden island meanwhile the u s military suspect that something is amiss on the island so they send their own team of men who give eaten by the supersized predators our heroes run into the last remaining scientist on the island dr susan richardson michelle borth of wonderland the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project who tells them that the military is going to target the island for destruction the title match between the two overgrown predators occurs in the last quarter hour after our heroes who have been consistently whittled down by the monsters find a helicopter and take off in time before the military pulverizes the island there s no tension suspense or anything worthwhile in this substandard creature feature the best thing about this yawner is composer chuck cirino s orchestral soundtrack it gives komodo vs cobra an epic feel usually jay andrews writes and directs tolerable drivel but this ranks far below his low standards the sexy women fare better at survival than the guys in one scene our heroic group fords a river and we don t get to see any wet t shirts drat there s nothing in the way of memorable dialogue or relationships in this dreck i think that the military guys do far too much saluting when they get their heads together to conspire let s hope that michael pare got a good payday out of this garbage the ending as one of the scientists takes on the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as an afterthought it s not so bad it s good it s just bad 
20,i must in light of the encomia of praise for this flick from viewers assume once again the role of the turd in the punchbowl as lowell weicker used to say i am scratching my head at the sheer number of laudatory comments the african queen this ain t the period flavor is wonderful yes the acting is fine but no actor no matter how great can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant party and dinner table conversation here and i care not how much of it is taken from joyce s text imagine spending an hour and a half as a fly on the wall at a christmas dinner of a not particularly interesting group of people it s not clear to me that it s a family as one person suggested having to listen to their mundane table talk and you have the essential experience of this movie absolutely nothing happens and nothing important is said but it is said at interminable length as i said the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me speaking of mysteries watch a good one rather than this 
605,this may not be one of the best movies ever made but overall it s a very enjoyable light hearted piece of froth in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time highly recommended for it s feel good factor alone ok so frank sinatra s acting leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film sinatra went on to make many more films where his undoubted acting ability shone through but in this his first venture into hollywood his voice not his acting is his main contribution to this movie i ve just watched it again on tv and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time i saw it many many years ago 
28,in stand by me vern and teddy discuss who was tougher superman or mighty mouse my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan bruce lee and jet li it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead but it is a fun one and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan in this film he comes across as a martial arts god black mask is about a man that was created along with many other men to be supreme fighting machines their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose they are invincible in some ways now that is the premise for the film but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes jet li is a marvel he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do and that is what makes watching him so fun besides the martial arts in the film black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co star the police officer they are great together but to be honest if anyone is reading this review they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department and the answer to that is a resounding yes lots and lots of gory mindless action you will love this film 
441,some 25 year olds behave like teenagers coping with the death of a high school mate trying to find their purpose in live and love the script is so lame that i had to force myself to even finish this movie stay away from it 1 10
607,i was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they participated in this sham bad dialogue worse worst acting lifeless all the way and the cast knew it the two preceding movies which this attempted to copy had life sparkle and were captivating 
998,well here we have yet another role reversal movie there were many worth watching despite the tired plot of gender reversal however this one is not in previous reviews i think i ve made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late 80s this is one of them just one of the girls is about a high school kid corey haim who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader marie nicole eggert obviously he can t keep up the charade for too much longer i thought this movie was utter crap and it wasn t even funny but judging by a majority of reviews it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen nicole eggert are the only ones who d want to watch this if you re looking for a good haim feature or role switching comedy look no further than 1989 this is about the point that haim s career tanked 
680,as most other reviewers seem to agree this adaptation of after the funeral is very good indeed always one of my favourite poirot stories i was worried that it might be messed about with well it was a little bit but only a little bit and the end the result was thoroughly entertaining david suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as poirot and as others have pointed out the other star of this show is monica dolan who surely could not be bettered as miss gilchrist i also really enjoyed fiona glasscott who was spot on as the cutting rosamund shane but really the casting was quite impeccable throughout one point is knocked off for the adaptors not being able to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes the business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although i didn t mind how they tightened up the structure of the abernethie family in the book the family tree is really quite complicated the final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and i found the very end when they all leave enderby quite touching this is really one of the very best of the poirot series so far 
287,i couldn t believe that this movie dates from 2007 it had all the looks of a below average seventies horror flick didn t they have any knowledge of modern special effects or cgi didn t they know that in the post millennium the violence in a supposed horror and or scifi movie should at least be a little bit graphic or did i get the purpose wrong was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal bound together in the big cycle of life or a warning to mankind not to mess with nature or something like that it doesn t really matter either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts first of all the premise is very improbable if at a given time you re capable of replacing a total eye no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time that s totally unprofessional and to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient and why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans and make the victim look like a freak by the way i noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy like normal dark eyes couldn t they have waited for such a specimen the story is lame it s about this poor guy aaron who gets these weird eye transplants which suddenly makes him feel like the donor wolf or at least that s what i make of it and then he s being chased by some military men especially this last bit is ridiculous i mean i can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment imagine soldiers with night vision eye sight but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient it s beyond me why they re out to kill him why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient a volunteering soldier maybe and why try to kill everyone else that s involved with poor aaron isn t that a bit steep who the hell are these militaries anyway i hope not the us army or the government they behave like psychopaths walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons raiding private apartments like they re after some public enemy 1 and displaying during the ultimate show down in the woods a total lack of discipline like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren panicking and shooting randomly around aaron for some unfathomable medical reason feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes why would that be he suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves what is this are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor wolf are situated in it s eye balls and that the recipient of these eye balls also adopts the wolf s craving for red life meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all fours like a cat can a wolf even do that the acting or the lack thereof didn t help the credibility of all this either everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls especially this indian girl she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression vexed and some disinterested mumblings about the force of nature and it beats me why aaron all of a sudden is all over her but hey there probably had to be at least one love scene i really sympathized with actor cory monteith who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face but they didn t give him much to go with he has to run around bare chested for more than half of the movie which could have been fun to watch but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique monteith really should leave his shirt on his few killings and attacks are hardly shown we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there s another victim lying down and aaron with some more blood on his face and chest not much for a modern sci fi horror the only good acting came from justine bateman and i really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty something lady she did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions but they made her character a kind of a wimp who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries what a pity that the script didn t make her stand up a bit more in the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie hardly scary or thrilling with unbelievable goings on a lot of overlong national geographic like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes who cares some pretentious indian ramblings about man and nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments i guess the word superfluous covers it all 
967,though not a greek i have had a lifelong interest in the eastern empire its fall in 1453 was the greatest loss to christianity in its entire history yet while the easter empire is not a topic much discussed in american intellectual circles the us did not merely mimic golden byzantiums public architecture the us is much absorbed in the fated byzantine historical cycle and now has faced many of the crises involving certain people of a middle eastern extraction about whom it is said that there is a slight tendency for excessive exuberance on religious matters which humbled great byzantium i wonder if the loss of the ability to speak plainly was the first sign post on the road to disaster john romer is to be credited not only for his excellent production but also for his joyful enthusiasm for the subject which is most refreshing not recommended for americans who like political correctness 
781,what a bad movie i m really surprised that deniro and even snipes would be associated with something like this if you re going to make a movie that involves baseball and shows scenes of baseball at least make the action look somewhat realistic why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games possible spoiler and the last scene in the movie what was that we are somehow led to believe that deniro has found his way onto the field in an umpire s uniform and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour one of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie 3 stars out of 10 
310,ah such an original title for a very shoddy film the dubbing is hilarious since the voices and mouths never seem to match as a result i had no idea what was going on as i watched this mess unfold there are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end the aztec ceremony had me laughing i rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever the singing aztec lady is comic naturale and the dancing and costumes are a hoot some guy gets a face full of acid there s a lot of fighting you have no idea who any character is not that i really cared and it s a whole noir mess oh and the actual fight doesn t happen for awhile so during the movie feel free to get up take a nap take a trip you won t miss anything exciting 
64,that s pretty ridiculous i hope many people are exposed to muslims who live all over the u s u k and all over the world the religion has over a billion followers i myself born and bread in america and through my religious classes and teachings i have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society i am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world i have know many muslims from all over and i have traveled to countries like pakistan i have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media i wonder why also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion its a religion of one billion people and these are less than one percent i am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the kkk ira and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge personal or business matters through their so called religion
579,i saw this film at the london premiere and i have to say i didn t expect much but i did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining the original basic instinct was no great film and is still something of a smut classic but it was entertaining i can recall countless times flipping through channels on tv on a late friday or saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it however this lame brain waaay belated sequel has nothing is sharon stone still gorgeous well let s put it this way for a 47 year old she s pretty hot is she as beautiful as she was in the original no she also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing she doesn t look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress and whatnot the rest of the performances range from bad to terrible and michael caton jones a typically safe director one who doesn t always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies has officially delivered his first true turkey a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious i hear the film went through multiple editing sessions and it s very clear from the start nothing makes much sense the whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending oh my talk about stupid and unbelievable still predictable though i saw gigli i saw son of the mask and although i m not looking to smear this film i can say with my own authority which you don t have to agree with at all mind you that i prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure by the way stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy type nightclub basic instinct 2 basically it stinks too 
724,warning small plot details revealed i can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film it is written so badly that every character is a caricature yet it seems to take itself seriously it is poorly cast especially ralph macchio all baby faced 5 foot nothing of him as a streetwise tough plot elements are all drawn in black and white with every situation almost immediately escalating to some extreme climax most egregious of all plot element about to be revealed it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi serious film one can just imagine the filmmakers saying we need jobeth to shed her top hmmm i ve got it early in the film let s give nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the hallways then jobeth can use that line on him later and really bare herself in the hallway yeah that s the ticket i will give the producers credit for tackling a weighty subject in 1984 one that proved all too weighty in the late 90 s with events like columbine however the execution is dreadful this film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of heathers a campy political statement like network or a serious examination like brubaker instead it tries to be all of these things and ends up being none of these things teachers get an f 
158,although a tear jerker it is definitely a feel good movie all the actors were excellent and will smith as always does the job and does it well i could go on but pick any ten of the 10 ratings and they ve said it as well and likely better than i could but since i must include at least 10 lines to post a comment i will say that rosario dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer her performance was most enjoyable and i look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come and this film demonstrates that will smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor 
600,it is a truism that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie this one is no exception i am no lover of yanks but their amazingly simplistic view of the world and their ability to reduce everything to black and white as well as make events even fictional ones in novels fit an agenda that bears little or no relationship to complexity of any kind is irritating in the extreme wilbur smith is descriptively verbose but weaves intricate tales that deserve more than has been delivered by this awful mishmash of a movie sad really for those who will never read smith they will be left with a less than decent portrayal of his egyptian series which has to be said is gigantic in its exposition the indiana jones movies were snappy to attempt to replicate that by manipulating smith s novels into this production misses out by a country mile pathetic except for the photography and art malik 
137,it feels like swedish movies are trying to become more american and i just don t get it in this movie the performance of some of the actors is horrible and the script is nothing special don t waste your time 
833,this is another alien imitation and not a very good one at that replace outer space with the south african desert throw in the same ingredients a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film a group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of flesh their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster the african location is pretty enough but that is basically all this film has going for it there is a vain attempt to build up the tension but i found this didn t really work and made the film rather boring the creature didn t appear much and when it did it didn t really install a feeling of horror there is one scene where someone gets the flesh ripped from his arm but that was basically it on the gore front in conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching paint dry i give this film 4 10 and that is only because of the interesting location which alone isn t enough to save this movie from being a total snooze fest
143,gen y cops since i heard of the film being in release i have been wanting to see it because i loved gen x cops i was a little disappointed that a nicholas tse didn t return and b too much slapstick nevertheless i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film but it is good in its own way stephen fung returns as the ultracool ladies man match who has a steady girl in oli note where is haze and sam lee returns as the insane alien this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of english the real star of the film is newcomer edison chen he makes a great replacement for nicholas tse as edison i also enjoyed paul rudd s performance of agent curtis he seems to be the tough as nails smartmouth fbi agent you d love to hate but soon you d like his character the fight scenes are a lot better in this one even though there are very few but they are great courtesy of jackie chan stuntman nicky li look for a cameo from ron smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with match smoorenburg also is the stunt double for rudd if you liked gen x cops you ll love gen y cops 
594,fun story of a regular guy with big dreams this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success great performances by lou myers and brian s neighbor alex i giggled alot and even cried a little 
935,i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts and to be honest i didn t know how much i would like it i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised driving lessons is a modest simple film which draws you in right from the start rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly he s definitely one to look out for in the future dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity the highlight of the film for me was evie s rather colourful poem it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs in my opinion watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours the scenery was also striking especially the countryside anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable i strongly disagree with
205,if you want to truly experience the magic of don dohler then check out alien factor or maybe fiend but not this alien factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it s fairly creepy but nightbeast which i guess is sort of an updating of alien factor is just plain dumb actors sleepwalk through their roles especially mr monotone sheriff and the monster is some dumb halloween mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative but kind of stupid looking critters from alien factor a spaceship crashes on earth and there s a critter inside of course who runs around vaporizing people and ripping off arms etc and he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too until it gets shot out of his hand and that s really about it alien factor beats this mess hands down if you really want to see a good don dohler movie check that out instead and rip don dohler 12 2 06 
382,first off i just want to say that this show could ve done well way better than it s doing now what brought it down was certainly the acting miranda cosgrove who acts as the main character carly looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on drake and josh unfortunately icarly was a big let down not only can miranda not act convincingly enough but she s incredibly stiff when she moves she looks as if she s not sure how the character carly would move or stand in the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up her arm doesn t ever leave her side from her elbow up even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze and the singing the theme song was great only because drake had been in it the music was pretty good and miranda s voice sounded fake i have to admit the plot and settings are good unrealistic but hey that s nick they re practically known for stupid lines and characters but wow is icarly the worst of them all 
372,jet li is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world he has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame while he is big in asia he is almost unknown here in the us black mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him but it fails horribly first of all it is dubbed while it may have camp value the dubbing isn t even close and it is flat in tone it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer secondly the director in this movie daniel lee does a horrible job he cuts scenes so fast at times you don t know what s going on other times the camera shakes and wobbles fans see jet li s movies for the fantastic martial arts however the director edits the scenes so fast that you don t even know who s who half the time other times a scene is left hanging ie li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep while the badguys arm their guns two seconds later both li and the love interest are already under the car other scenes are so improbable that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous killer cd roms just give him throwing stars li needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic mise a scene the added rap techno music goes from being okay to intrusive the plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for and are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize simon because he has a half mask on wouldn t the hair lower jaw or voice give it away if you want to see a jet li movie try iron monkey or his classic shaolin temple this disjointed mess is a complete waste of time 2 10
855,boasting the title for the sickest film ever made pink flamingos is an undisputed classic sure the camerawork is shaky and off center the story is muddled and slow paced and every single character in the movie is repugnant and despicable but pink flamingos has a certain playful charm and brilliant satiric wit that no other movie can match while this film is indeed an offensive one reading descriptions of what goes on in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it only john waters can succeed in making rape murder sadism cannibalism coprophagia and just about every other form of human debauchery known to man seem absolutely hilarious this movie must be seen to be believed 
312,i first saw this movie when i was a freshman in high school and the film has stuck with me through the years it s not about the soundtrack or cinematography or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting it s about the educational purpose and the message behind that is the most important it s not a sin to have a child when you re a teenager and still in high school and it s not really a bad thing either but it is a problem tons of girls i knew are all having children now and i guess they never watched this great movie and if they did they clearly didn t get the message behind it all it s about not taking chances when you re in a sexual relationship any girl can get pregnant the first time it s not a myth you don t necessarily lose out on your dreams but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first this movie has a clear message behind it just say no 
358,this has to be one of if not the greatest mob crime films of all time every thing about this movie is great the acting in this film is of true quality master p s acting skills make you actually believe he is italian the cinematography is excellent too probably the best ever this movie was great and i have the brain capacity of an earth worm 
341,not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie half way through but then with this one i was only 15 minutes in when i considered unfortunately i did make it all the way through make sure that you do not it s not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual it s that it s not any of those things yet it so desperately wants to be all of them instead it s boring trite ordinary predictable and unexceptionally poorly executed shot on video high school special effects no sense of even basic visual storytelling dialog barely audible not that it s worth hearing though this movie is proof for the argument that even the straight to video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere 
118,i understand the jokes quite well they just aren t good the show is horrible i understand it and that s another horrible thing about it the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible it s not funny not funny i don t want people to say only smart people get it because if they re so smart why do they judge people they don t even know and say that they re not smart or intellectual enough to understand it it s like saying the sky is red but never looking outside but anyways this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life the jokes are terrible i mean you can understand them they re just horrible her controversy is very lame her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting i m not sure what these smart people see in this show but judging others when they don t even know anything about any of us isn t exactly a smart comment 
510,in the lost son a private eye searching for a missing man stumbles upon a child prostitution ring this film incorporates all of the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst case scenario that exists only in the minds of hollywood the press and ag john asscrap if you get a chance to see this you d be better off getting lost yourself 
324,terrible film with frank sinatra as tony rome here he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman naturally it s the woman below the sea her room mate lainie kazan soon winds up dead on the floor an aging richard conte plays a police officer and friend of rome when a local club owner gets killed the blame falls on rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene that s how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action raquel welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue her acting leads a lot to be desired martin gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him by the film s end you don t know why the girl was murdered don t even bother to ask 
354,a less than subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the catholic church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show throughout the show dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked especially if god is so good why does he allow evil to exist in the world diane keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version though some might disagree of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the company line and condemns half the world to burn in hell to celebrate her school s 25th anniversary she invites her first students to return and perform their christmas pageant however when the quartet update their play to parody sister mary s fallacious teachings the nun is pushed over the edge sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events the ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts not recommended go watch the play instead 
692,let s see there s a civil war a lost city a talking gorilla some regular gorillas a previously unknown species of killer albino gorilla the most powerful laser ever known to man a lot of diamonds lying mined and loose in the sand attack hippos an active volcano and a hot air balloon packed in a suitcase in a downed plane that s not too much is it i ve had more coherent fever dreams and then the romanian guy picked up a bunch of diamonds because this was a lost city that he had been looking for or something but then the mean gorillas that we had seen before came out of nowhere and ate him now somehow the talking gorilla was back from visiting the regular gorillas and as a kind of earthquake or volcano started the woman industrialist doctor built a gun using a laser and this big diamond she had just found in her dead fiance s hand it s a blast if you re looking for more ammunition against the pernicious influence of michael crichton in american entertainment and hence world entertainment and if you keep firmly in mind the extent to which this cynical and half hearted attempt fell on its face at the boxoffice but sadly the men responsible crichton sceenwriter john patrick shanley director frank marshall probably never lost a dime shame on them and i mean that 1 10
934,the first time i ve seen this dvd i was not only happy because of the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band put out anything but also because the dvd itself is extremely loud jimmy page obviously can t live with quiet music i guess i do must say though that during the concert at royal albert hall they expanded how many more times and moby dick too long other than that it was exquisit my favorite song of all time is now on that dvd trampled underfoot it s either that one or in my time of dying in that song jimmy really plays that thing good ever seen randy rhoads play well jimmy plays just like him except his guitar is lower 
555,i don t know what it is with these brady kids first barry williams publicly brags about having sexy with his tv sister maureen mccormick then about dating his tv mom florence hederson then susan cindy olsen does music for a bunch of porno movies then mike bobby lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving finally maureen marcia mccormick and eve jan plum might have had a little same sex fling on the side now christopher peter knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early 20s during his stint on the surreal life which at first was fun to watch and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship the last episode where she posed for a bunch of nude photographs with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give to christopher for his birthday was not a good move on her part and he dealt with it in a very mature fashion just picking up and leaving to clear his head i think he was always bowing to her every need and now he s finally taking a stand and i hate to say it but i think she abuses him verbally the way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she reams him for every little thing also she talks openly about having flings with other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on him with women and men which is not something any self respecting human being should do when already married to someone if this were a man talking down to his wife like that and going out every night partying and having sex with other people everyone would be rallying behind the wife to leave him why should this be any different what started out as a cute little crush on another reality show blossomed into a huge disaster adrianne as beautiful as she is is like another britney spears and lindsay lohan clearly in need of some therapy because she cries like a baby over so many silly things i feel sorry for her but chris needs to rid himself of her because he is a good man who cannot afford to be humiliated like this 
160,i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressed it is essentially a mystery thriller where this girl who can t remember anything gets rescued by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool i really liked the setting of this one a desolate post modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings very metropolitan groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity surprising it was made in 1980 seems somewhat ahead of it s time 8 out of 10 kids 
267,another awful movie from hollywood this time a female helps the revolution in a central american country yeah yeah yeah hey lets make a movie without any sense of realism at all i am so sick of movies like this one the actors and actresses are lousy the effects are cheesy and the dialog horrible and suddenly i see john rhys davies as the evil president from gimli to hugo louis ramos i bet he is very proud of this well i shouldn t have expected much of this movie and i didn t and i am glad cause this sucks bigtime i wonder what kind of people who like this movie my guess is younger people aged 12 16 and i guess some people like because of kristin dattilo well i am in neither of those group and i hate it rating 2
276,mpaa rated r for violence language nudity and brief drug use quebec rating 13 canadian home video rating 18ai saw coonskin today this film is also known as bustin out and street fight after watching fritz the cat i wanted to see more of bashki s films i saw cool world and thought it was mediocre and i saw this when it was first released the film was very controversial it was considered racist and al sharpton wanted the film banned he even led protests outside the theatre where the film was playing the film was only released on vhs under the title street fight it is now considered a cult classic film and african american celebrities such as comedian richard pryor director spike lee and the rap group the wu tang clan are said to have enjoyed this film i personally thought fritz the cat was a much better film but this is very enjoyable as well worth watching for bashki or blaxploitation film fans the film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film who framed roger rabbit i would have preferred it in full animation but whatever the film starts off with a reverend and another man racing to rescue two of their friends from prison while the prisoners wait the older one tells a story of three men he knew the film then switches into animation format we see three black men who sold their house to this man they decide to make names for themselves in harlem so the leader a black rabbit kills a big player in harlem and he basically becomes a big shot the film moves on as the italian mafia want him out the mafia involves the godfather his three sons who are homosexual and an italian clown coonskin is an entertaining animated film that s worth checking out if you can find it 
715,it s some years since i ve seen this movie so forget most of the details however i loved it at the time and found the plot intensely gripping the climax heart stopping i remember being literally on the edge of my seat at the theatre back in 1979 jane fonda plays a los angeles reporter kimberley who stumbles upon an accident at a local nuclear power facility she wants to go public with the story aided by her hippie cameraman michael douglas who has photographed the event but a sinister conspiracy attempts to cover it all up jack lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the nuclear plant s conflicted middle manager torn between loyalty to his company and doing the right thing by reporting the perilous situation his facial expressions speak volumes here apart from the engrossing plot and riveting tension this film is all about jack lemmon his character and his superb acting performance as for jane fonda i was a huge fan of hers at the time i suspect she just moved on from her anti war protests to taking on the nuclear industry this movie seems intended as a nuclear scare tactic chernobyl and three mile island notwithstanding they re different types of reactors our canadian candu reactor is safe and well respected around the world i wouldn t hesitate to reside near the nuclear power plant about an hour s drive away where my friend works as a very competent engineer apparently they shut down for every teeny problem irregardless of the financial loss i sincerely doubt that there are any conspiracies afoot there one can hardly imagine any of the managers or highly trained operators willing to risk any sort of meltdown or whatever it s absolute tomfoolery of course the moral here is to spare no expense or effort either in building the facility or ensuring its ongoing safety if we want our western lifestyle we have to get our energy somewhere for those who claim nuclear power can never be made completely safe true of course perhaps they should volunteer as a coal miner or else return to pre electricity horse and buggy days by all means enjoy this entertaining and highly suspenseful movie which apparently is based loosely embellished on a true story it s a real chiller a thriller and maybe even a killer but please don t get your attitudes about the operation and safety of nuclear power plants from it 
589,superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80 s exploitation hooray the pre credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we re dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we re up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fist fights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister s naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes well bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesn t mind at all sick dude anyway as kids they fled from russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy a friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers when the actual plot lifts off 20 years later they re facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of white fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch most of the time you have no clue who s beating up who or for what cause and i bet the actors understood even less but whatever the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly and i won t reveal for what reason bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes bo s principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film there s the obligatory we re falling in love montage and loads of other attractions my god what a brilliant experience the original french title translates itself as life to survive which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie none 
848,it s a refreshing breath of air when a movie actually gives you a story line with a beginning a middle and a end a nice clever mystery with an appealing heroine for all ages who wins us over with her wit and charm andrew fleming s film is indeed a modern marvel a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in hollywood he puts away the over reliance on special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a terrific film with a very capable young actress and a talented supporting cast the film is based on the old books but it has been given updated enough to put in this century however the props might be different the heart still is a good mystery and there is clever one here one that ties the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth emma roberts is an old fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others details that are sorely missing from today s films she is still good enough to get boys attentions but she also knows how present poise and self respect she earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little guile when it is needed to achieve her goals while taking a vacation to california our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play suddenly she is visited by her ghost and this sets off a series of events that might solve the mystery or result in something dreadful for herself what makes the movie quite entertaining is the little details as she discovers that her customary world is nothing compared to the california scene and this is well presented without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or overtly sexual eventually the director has enough control to make it all very palatable to all types of audiences from the young ones to the adults in the audience it is a movie that deserves to be seen appreciated and enjoyed a film that is rare and delicate and it s not afraid to be classified as fun five stars
533,i watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white tv i remember my father remarking that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes were blackened i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in 45 years i still remember it vividly the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters with the final scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me all these years 
48,just watched it on the hallmark channel i was surprised to john denver this movie was full of clich√©s but that is to be expected a made for tv christmas movie come on the acting is as good as any other 80 s made for tv movie the story is as i said before predictable and clich√© but still good if you are looking for a campy christmas movie it will certainly scratch your itch i was also pleased when i learned that it took place in georgetown colorado it is a real mountain town west of denver very cool as this is my home region i was never a big john denver fan i always found him to be pretty foney but he was a decent actor he is very good as the good old boy like he played in this film if you get the chance to watch it than do i m sure it will be on again in 2007 
619,i don t believe this was an acting challenge for richard harris this was an uncomplicated plot yet interesting it is a good movie to watch when you don t want to do a lot of thinking just want to be told a simple story the canadian scenery was breathtaking the beautiful fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing 
173,some days ago in rome a young romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping a romanian girl who had seen everything reported what happened therefore it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from romania generalizing them as criminals everyone indiscriminately i m only 15 but i thought what idea of affluence does italy give to these poor people how ever do they regard us as the land of plenty yesterday evening i finally saw nuovomondo and my question had an answer when you have only a donkey and some goats those propaganda postcards showing united states as a land with milk rivers and huge vegetables makes such an impression nuovomondo is really a must see film it balances an ethereal symbolism milk rivers glances play hard and rocky mountains the name and character lucy luce and a cruel realism the mass of hopeful people on the ship the procedures at ellis island there s a mixed cast going from the angelic charlotte gainsbourg to the realistic vincenzo amato till a bitter and smashing aurora quattrocchi as the mother but was it really so hard to enter in the new world 
180,my take on the ending bobby died at the hands of his step father mike had tried as he may to get bobby out only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly bobby died mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind on how bobby left mike made a plane that flew bobby out children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survive was also great seeing my old housing area we called it san jose boulevard and i lived right around where these house were filmed it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses not studios it was my kitchen bedroom and living room and those hills we use to hike them as kids looking down on our little valley seeing glimpses of the bay was a real nostalgia trip for me 
859,artemesia takes the usual story about the art world eg you can t paint that but i want to and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film well interesting but not remarkable the story is about one of the first female painters around artemesia who course is fiercely independent but just can t stop thinking of men and their bodies for artistic purposes of course she soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist but soon tutoring becomes much more then art and soon after that scandal erupts funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a soft porn fantasy i mean was artemesia that much of a man hungry person also it s quite funny when she s insisting that she paints for herself yet falls for the first person she sees actually the story itself is quite fascinating and it ends with a trial which i always love but i wasn t too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldn t fall for i woulda gone for the young fisherman p:P
371,the running man is one of those films that if overwatched would become boring and depressing even my advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks in todays climate of tv media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary post 1980s boom forget that though there are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film schwarzenegger is on top form as ben the butcher of bakersfield richards and the inclusion of bond belting one liners was completely inspired thety are truly leg end dary with his rant to killian over a camera the main highlight the design of the stalkers is authentically american and mirrors the characterizations seen in the pc gladiators tv show and the wwe as well buzz saw s grisly end will chill any viewer to the core as a foot note why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour jesse venturer and sven ole thorssen are great as backing muscle and are arnies buds in real life and its even got mick fleetwood in it too what more could you ask for i highly recommend the running man if you re looking for a great piece of entertaining action with a glossty finish and some great characters just don t expect an education from it at least on surface value quality i bloody love it actually you will too unless you re a thesp 7 10
503,it s this sort of movie that you try and imitate by attempting to realise something then flying through the air almost immediately i d like to do that and i know you would too great stuff 
894,one of the more prominent popular episodes but clearly one of the worst a red shirt female falls for khan instead of dropping dead for a change and then proceeds to betray kirk and the enterprise as if loyalty were a non existent character trait on the ship makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant starfleet uses to test people when hiring we have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in wink of an eye when a red shirt male takes the enemy s side just because he falls in love same as in ss however in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot this is very silly because it once again makes kirk s crew seem like a bunch of soft headed easy to impress morons who once they fall in love with the enemy are capable of doing just about anything the fact that mcgivers switches back to kirk s side doesn t ameliorate the illogic in any way lord mcgiveth and the lord mctaketh why is khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength that s one of several st plot devices that undermine kirk s intelligence why does khan hold a knife against mccoy s throat if khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself and what s with a sikh being played with a latino accent montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach i was half expecting to hear the plaaain the plaaaain in the background at any moment why the hell would kirk or any ship captain provide limitless use of the ship s library concerning the innermost technical details of the enterprise to anyone is the starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots ss is a very cartoonish silly episode so no wonder trekkies love it it doesn t have too many sci fi elements in it which is what trekkies hate the most it also figures that the st franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie that way pleasing rabid trekkies who were so very disappointed with the first movie which you guessed it had far too much sci fi for the average tiny trekkie brain 
641,most films are crappy with high production values this one is crappy without high production values which sets it aside from the large pool of horrible movies as bad as this film was i need to give due respect to kathryn aselton who i believe if given the proper script could probably turn in a pretty good performance she plays emily the girlfriend to perennial doofus josh who often refers to her as dude or man in a non ironical tone but heres the thing emily is a semi believable character which means rhett will soon need to be added to the cast to counteract this almost believable character with a guy even more preposterous than josh when we first meet rhett we learn that he is deep because he is videotaping a lizard which is proof that he sees the world uniquely rhett then shows the tape to emily and in one of emily s few unbelievable moments she acts impressed by this amateur tape of a lizard wow i believe is how she responds once again with no irony of sarcasm even mildly implied from the opening scene you are given warning that the camera work will be crappy we open on a shaky close up of josh as he attempts to win over the viewers by acting goofy oh how care free this main protagonist is that he will act goofy haha this film could almost be a case study in just how bad films can be and for that matter just how far bad films can get in the festival circuit i mean by comparison of most circuit crap this film probably did appear pretty awesome i believe sxsw gave this film some minor award oh south by southwest why do you encourage them its only cruel but here is where i hand this film a compliment it is the best of the mumblecore movement mind you all other mumblecore movies sucked beyond belief and generally included grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting but still its good to be the best of something i haven t seen baghead yet but it looks like maybe they have made a few strides forward the preview at least made it appear tolerable where as even the puffy chair preview couldn t really hide the fact that it was going to suck i ve gotten off topic here anyways rhett is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor at all much like josh most likely isn t an actual actor but rather the director or brother of director there s some mixed messages there i think rhett was somebodies buddy and they said hey why don t you play this guy named rhett in the movie the fact that rhett is the name of the actor and character probably means the actor and character are the same unless i am mistaken which i am not if rhett shaved the raccoon off of his face you would probably say he was attractive so anyways rhett emily and josh team up to bring the puffy chair to rhett and josh s dad some stuff happens along the way more bad acting bad supporting actors crappy camera work an attempt at significance this film wouldn t have been bad if it hadnt been so shamelessly pursuing profound self importance the whole thing is amateurish if you can view this movie without paying for it like if its on tv or for rent at the library then consider looking at it just to see if you like this super cheap style of film making i like what the duplass are doing the whole make a movie with nothing concept but i wish they would make a movie that someone would want to see 
455,the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists and rightly so this deserves a lot better treatment the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft the rules of the day and winds up with a little girl instead not the conventional way and the problems that ensue afterward the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy which he obviously thought was the case the old man bianlian wang xu zhu is kind of funny looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin the little girl doggie zhou renying is a cutie the rest of the story is how the two manage after that i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes overall it s involving story complete with drama suspense humor and sadness just don t expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd until it comes out on widescreen rent it 
968,this is a really mediocre film in the vein of buckaroo banzai the cast runs around like mad max wannabes and they seem to be sharing a joke that they do not want to share with the audience wheeler nicholson is one of the those guilty pleasure actresses you are delighted to stumble across in films but she isn t worth the price of rental space maggot starts an electrical fire and burns a vote of 4 
653,this 1955 producers showcase version of the musical peter pan with mary martin has the benefit of showcasing most of the original broadway cast including kathleen nolan as wendy who was more natural an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color televised play it s a shame that most people won t sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production which doesn t even show up in the imdb listings when you put peter pan into the search engine is superior to the cutesier color version most people have watched i obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally now when i put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b w producers showcase televised version as an added plus the disc i got also showed the original commercials and opening promo how far away the 1950 s seem now such an innocent time compared to today i miss it 
706,despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky or think he s a tired relic from the 1960s i really had no opinion of the man save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist although i could not elucidate any of his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings so stumbling across the dvd of the 2003 documentary noam chomsky rebel without a pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 11 i decided to get it just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him while glad i got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was so what s all the fuss about for a man with so many degrees lauded as the most important intellectual alive by the new york times according to the dvd s case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and i wouldn t even want to watch what a william f buckley could do to him granted the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he d say rather than being on linguistics so maybe that s the reason he came off so badly but again if he is a linguist and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise even worse are his acolytes who seem to further insulate the man from reality by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film this much i knew he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the soviet empire the film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that it s difficult to separate all of the jumble his wife carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film she seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 11 was a great thing for the chomskys for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then not surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no biographical background it s assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this great man bears chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one stylistically there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that and slack jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him this is really poor film making by director and editor will pascoe who in the dvd s filmmaker statement shows he s yet another uncritical acolyte of chomsky s other than that one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere agitprop and a vanity piece of agitprop at that is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomsky s lectures at mcmaster university in ontario canada prior to the american invasion of iraq in 2003 much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era yes he makes some good points here and there on american media complicity before the war but he follows them up with sheer lunacy for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not fully plotted out cabals as example he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled similarly he claims trilateralists run the world and that people s fear of crime is yet another cabal s result of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district attorneys offices consume he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when castro and company were great sponsors of it in latin america asia and africa until the soviet union fell i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species mixing impregnation centers up in idaho in his simpleminded world without grays chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco whom he reviles are even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals in short chomsky is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually near this film s end he warns be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn t like no matter how barbarous their crimes and anti intellectual their posit please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant dvd 
232,the frogs who wanted a king or frogland is ladislaw starewicz s most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that i ve ever seen the ironic thing is that they pray to the god jupiter for their answers jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the amphibian creatures the frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives like i said this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children in fact i first saw this on the rhino vhs that had bambi meets godzilla that alone should tell you what to expect here 
802,well as goethe once said there really isn t any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on something that has had a great effect la maman et la putain has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what s been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film certainly should be dissuaded from watching it to express a purely subjective judgement however i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people don t watch it it s a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry and by that i don t mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty and so on and if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself however pessimistic his conclusions may be my beef with the film is rather that i don t see this hours long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree of course because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree because we see the least of her alexandre s affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value of course but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean pierre l√©aud is most likely not even acting and that with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray he really was just reproducing word for word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he along with the director eustache had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100 of the film it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow worthless and despicable post 68 milieu what made however this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman sleeping mostly in this very flat with another and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third well i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog eat dog world he s chosen to create for himself what i can t however in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty as i say if la maman et la putain is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre veronika and marie three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being unflinching though why one should even feel like flinching once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i can t imagine the problem however is that the director is clearly convinced and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics that alexander veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings emotional capabilities this latter idea however is arrant and offensive nonsense there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated miserable and alone or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter watch la maman et la putain if you re historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post 68 parisian milieu which was probably unfortunately not restricted to just a few particularly anti social types like these but please don t make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have 
636,this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness it s watchable and rather funny i don t think the film makers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality it s just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow as it s the middle of winter he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it s own this film is really stupid but it s funny the killings are hilarious i wouldn t advise you to go and buy it like i did the cover looked good but if it happens to be on tv one night and you re up for a laugh then stick it on 
974,to heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story it s set in a special ward for difficult cases the main story is loretta young s she s on leave from a long prison stretch for murder will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or heed her husband s plea for the opposite melodrama and sentiment are dominant and they re not the honest sort to say the least for example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies there are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a warners film mostly from glenda farrell who swigs gin from her hot water bottle while she waits to have twins that to her chagrin she finds there s now a law against selling an example of her repartee be careful farrell it s too late to be careful aline macmahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse but don t expect her to be given a dramatic moment the main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush even given the obvious limitations this film should have been better than it is 
796,this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa s finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon later episodes in the series of which there were four in total were not actually based on original dr seuss material although all but the last continued to use his familiar rhyming style the three sequels were gerald mcboing boing s symphony 1953 how now boing boing 1954 gerald mcboing boing on planet moo 1956 although he also appeared in a later episode of mr magoo 
292,tromeo and juliet is perhaps the best shakespeare modernization i have ever seen not that there s much competition but anyway all in all tromeo and juliet is definitely one of troma s better movies one of the little pearls hidden in a towering heap of dung it s a funny action packed gory take on the world s greatest love story but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as one can except from this kind of movie well except for the ending where tromeo and juliet kill juliet s abusive father and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their hideously mutated children this is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of shakespeare s scripts thumbs up 
885,what a fun b movie shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is a distinct and original he really brought me back to the monsters of the 80 s the budget is obviously low and not everybody is pacino behind the lens but it doesn t matter because it never once takes itself seriously from the trailer trash redneck to the high flying martial arts moves of the scarecrow this is truly a b movie gem grab some refreshments snacks and a couple friends and kick back and relax i enjoyed this film so much i went out a purchased all 3 scarecrow films sure they re not for everybody but to each his own sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile 
522,ag was an excellent presentation of drama suspense and thriller that is so rare to american tv sheriff lucas gave many a viewer the willies we rooted for caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of sheriff lucas we became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters the manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what lucas would do next were truly surprising this show lived up to the gothic moniker in ways american entertainment has so seldom attempted much less mastered the suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show this show puts shame to the current glut of reality shows which are so less than satisfying viewing the call for a dvd box set is well based this show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing a public that is tiring of over saturation of mind numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling bring on the dvd box set 
329,so your bairns are away on a sleep over the wife is visiting the mother in law you though are at home it s a dark and stormy night and there is no football on the telly and the dishwasher needs stacking so now what are you going to do i will tell you go make an old fashioned cocoa frys is best get hold of some ginger nuts and sit down in front of the dvd now go select and play arthur askeys world war two thriller horror the ghost train return to that comfortable settee and enjoy the night in the ghost train is a genuine british war time classic arthur askey with his side kick stinker murdoch entertain you and i suspect the cast to a high octane thrills and spills espionage thriller it s set in old rural england during the second world war it centres around a motley group of people that need to stay overnight through circumstances outside any ones control in an old railway waiting room that they discover is haunted by an old train the plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit to the entire cast it is humorous in parts and at times genuinely scary the tale was written by that old boy godfrey of dads army fame and it is clever arthur askey is entertaining and is very at home preforming his routines to you and the cast he also shows he can act a bit the cast are never out staged though even the railway porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas oh and when it ends please remember to stack the dish washer 
919,christopher guest is the master of the mockumentary werner herzog is one of many documentary greats out there zak penn isn t good at either but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two guest often plays around with reality and fiction but the line between the two is always clear in his films sort of an essential with a mockumentary penn could also take a lesson from the the blair witch project even though you knew it was a fake documentary going in you totally bought into the world the filmmakers created it seems to the audience as if the whole thing is real even though you know deep down you re watching fiction in other words it was fiction successfully disguised as truth in fact many early audiences watching it at sundance and other premiere audiences thought it was real penn whose forte by his own admission is screen writing should probably stick to that documentary or mockumentary film making and it s hard to tell where one begins and the other ends with this film is obviously not penn sets the stage for what he tries to sell as a legit documentary on the filming of a documentary sort of a meta documentary penn however confuses the audience and loses their trust from the get go as he enters herzog s house before the filming of herzog s film enigma of loch ness about the myth of the loch ness monster a film which apparently was never finished probably because of penn s interference even though penn is apparently the director of the film we re watching he starts it by looking at the cameras and saying what is the film crew doing here and starts shying away from them he does this on a couple other occasions as well he will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming thus forcing the camera guy to hide in the shadows to pick up snippets of dialogue between herzog and penn it seems to be a gimmick but that is never made clear and penn is apparently keeping us in the dark intentionally this leaves the audience scratching its head wondering who is in charge here if penn is working against his own film crew what kind of a world are we a part of this is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction penn seems to only fully enter the fictional world i think when the crew has sightings of what appears to be the loch ness monster but by the time the monster makes its first appearance we have totally exited the fictional world penn has attempted to create so it all just seems silly and pointless this is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity in that penn has a chance to document a master at work but completely loses focus and it becomes a movie about penn and his antics instead of the filming of a documentary penn s presence begins to pervade and overshadow everything else in the movie the herzog interviews are convincing and we actually believe he isn t acting we even start to wonder if he and others on his crew are being duped by penn much the way the audience is but you re never sure of even that penn in his interviews to the camera attempts to be quirky and unintentionally funny like the characters interviewed in a guest mockumentary but he only succeeds in being annoying in a guest film this effect is hilarious while here it falls flat because you re never sure what penn is about as a result we the audience start to dislike him as much as the crew apparently does aside from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous appearance out of nowhere of a beautiful model thrown in to give the movie spice there is little to recommend here perhaps its only redeeming quality an unintentional one at that is that it s a great example of why the audience is important and by completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling your doing them a disservice for that reason alone i think this would be a good film to show to film students sort of a what not to do kind of movie i have nothing against a movie told in an unconventional way as long it s done skillfully with a thematic base to give it substance this film is completely lacking in that i d like to call it a valiant effort at something but i m not sure what it is other than a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time as a side note it seems like bad art always calls to mind good this film made me think of the book picture by lillian ross ross followed john huston around during the filming of the red badge of courage and brilliantly documented it for the new yorker it would make a great movie in fact if you want a great example of meta art read it 
202,i watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic australian wastelands into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children s adventure movie the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed if you haven t seen this film yet then simply don t let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself a very painful hour and a half spoiler alert the other major issue i had with this film that truly left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man we had already seen him in the road warrior where he had helped max and yet when he reappears in thunderdome it looks like the two had never met whether he was supposed to be a different character or a relative of the road warriors gyro man i do not know however it was not explained and is a weak element in this overall weak film 2 out of 10 doesn t get a 1 10 because of the thunderdome fight 
481,i try to be diverse in my movie watching i can get into pride and prejudice as easily as i get into disappearing acts love jones is my all time favorite it is the standard by which i judge any modern urban romantic comedy shot very well the shot of nia and darius riding up lakeshore drive on the motorcycle is one of classic 3 second movie shots of all time of course no one will ever remember it when it came out i though it would be a new paradigm for modern urban film making good actors no guns and so forth the movie industry has disappointed me to a certain degree you will have your occasional drumline or roll bounce or tyler perry s why did i get married so whenever i need to see my people presented on screen in a very professional and stylish way i pop in love jones there is no best movie ever made to many people and opinions for that but it is my personal best my favorite line from love jones baby i just wanna come up and talk 
623,i remember watching this for the first time in the 80 s as a teen man i ve read the reviews on this trash and i find myself astonished by the voting this movie does not deserve four stars this movie is not better than topgun topgun has its own problems don t get me wrong this movie should be banned just for its own stupidity so many stereotypes so many loop holes so much poor dialog i cannot think of one redeeming quality of this vomit this is not action adventure this is a bad joke on film kinda like watching plan 9 with stock f 16 footage this movie not only defies logic and common sense within the context of a military setting it sends a disturbing message the military is not going to save your dad from the imminent evil of the middle east b ds so go out there and hijack a multi million dollar weapon and blast him out of the sinister clutches of the backwards anti american arabs cuz you can t reason with those animals this is a bruckheimer flick without a budget bland direction weak acting lame music idiotic plot equals iron eagle 
326,what can i say about this movie that has not been said by all the other comments here they pretty much sum up everything the people who love it cherish it the people who hate it well they loathe it this is the movie equivalent of marmite i personally have committed every second of it to memory it is cyclical claustrophobic introspective magical and stands as being one of the most unique films ever made despite what many have stated i believe this truly is a cult movie it is a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered once unearthed it s fantastical psychedelic visuals and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable which is an achievement in itself one of my friends who watched it likened it more to a musical and in many respects to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made would probably get more out of it to view head as such i was always fond of the monkees especially the t v show back when it was repeated during the 80 s my mum had recorded head for me when it was shown on t v late night as she knew i liked them i watched it a day later and it lodged in my memory until i was able to find a copy on dvd about 2 decades later what i would love now is a special edition it would be fascinating to get a greater insight into the making of this masterpiece we can only hope 
810,when i first watched robotboy i found it fresh and interesting but then i noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is good bad episodes became predictable and main characters are not interesting again we see a hyper smart boy beaten by his older brother parents who don t understand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy also this show has no logic a super modern robot who works on two aa size batteries and can use a lot of weapons but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super activated modes we see two different robots and it declines main idea of the show robot must learn how to behave himself in human society 
304,charles chic sales is absolutely terrific as the sole member of the leeds family willing to testify against a gangster they saw murder a policeman and an informant he fought at bull run in the civil war and his patriotism runs high even after his son in law is beaten and one of his grandson s is kidnapped by the gang intimidating all the other members fear of his grandson s death is no excuse he says he wouldn t want his grandson living in a country run by gangsters anyway the conflict between civic duty and personal safety is driven home sharply in this oscar nominated story walter huston is also a standout as the hard driving district attorney threatening the family with perjury if they don t back up their identification of the killer in court the rest of the cast including the sleazy killer ralph ince are all excellent and the film is snappily directed by william a wellman there s also good suspense as sales disappears just as the trial is about to begin 
36,waldemar daninsky paul naschy travels to tibet and is bitten by a yeti which causes him to become a werewolf he is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover and is later revived by a female scientist dr ilona ermann who uses him in mind control experiments daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor s failed experiments upon hearing of naschy s death from colleague jon kitley i rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch in my scramble i found i own not one but three copies of fury of the wolfman the film is of questionable video quality the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times and the american versions have two love scenes removed quite frankly without a remastered uncut copy i wasn t really getting the proper movie in all its glory this film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf count waldemar daninsky i suspect this is true but you wouldn t know this from the film itself the plot is confusing at times and there s really no indication that this is a sequel if you read the plot summaries on wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box you ll see that i m not alone in my confusion perhaps the film s shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through while floating around for years it was only released in 1973 due to problems involved in finding a distributor and naschy said in his autobiography that the director zabalza was an incompetent alcoholic and that he hated working with him those really aren t light accusations and i have no idea what zabalza had to say on his own behalf chances are sooner or later you ll come across a low grade version of fury of the wolfman it appears in a variety of three packs and box sets so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know what really needs to happen is an american uncut version with a decent sound and video mix and the love scenes thrown back in as far as i know this does not exist let us honor paul naschy s legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves 
90,this move is slow plodding cold dark and without a plot or hope it follows that tried and true european formula that they love to subsidize that is never seen but that the critics think makes an important point the movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between americans and europeans regarding employment in this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel it s the government s duty to provide them with work whereas in the u s we know we have to go out there and create value for someone spain never looked so backward 
940,hmmmmmmm cheerleader massacre let me think high school girls get sliced up except the cute one survives got it next movie i was actually surprised this one was made in 2003 i really thought they quit making these movies in the 80 s this was truly your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy dumb male horn dogs even dumber male adult and hot teacher it continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods we have seen it all before however this one had a few interesting plot twists that places it above the normal me too slashers so if you have got a few brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill you could do worse 
633,if you ever watched the dukes of hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children if you ve seen the movie you know that is no longer the case this movie was horrible main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what i call entertainment they took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services i was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out 15 minutes into the movie i was ready to leave i stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute i wish i had never seen this movie it trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when i left do yourself a favor go see something worth your money cause it s not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back 
363,now this is one of big s best jack hulbert s single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey murdoch it boasts a great stalwart cast who ham the play up for all they re worth especially askey of course histrionics were provided by linden travers melodramatics by herbert lomas and pragmatics by richard murdoch the group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for ghostly trains spectral porters hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all his repartee with everyone falls between side splitting and ghastly dull when the formula works it s very good but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is but those damn treacherous fifth columnists thank any god britain hasn t got any nowadays ultimately a nice harmless film to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you ll probably be very disappointed 
931,funny sad charming these are all words that floated through my head while i was watching this beautiful simple film it is rare that a movie truly moves me but shall we dance accomplished that with grace to spare gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history it left me with a quiet sense of exultation but with a small touch of sadness mixed in and the dancing oh yes the dancing even if you are not a lover of the art or can t put one foot in front of another the steps displayed here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can it was absolutely enchanting even the parts that show sugiyama s touchingly portrayed by koji yakusho stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous child like way and yet this film was not entirely about dancing but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings we witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast beauty pain emotion all the love and little agonies of life are here expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture 
945,perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia s comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren t laughing if there s anybody who s insecure it s a comedian who won t shut up about his audience then again perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia s comedy is that he doesn t get off his free speech high horse if you want to be funny just make a joke don t explain all the reasons why you re saving the american way with your failed attempts at generating laughter hmm actually the worst thing about carlos mencia s comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor avoid this like the plague 
264,one of the few reasons to make these pointlss films is to give some actors a chance to hopefully star in better films if they re acting is any good the only good thing in this movie is the acting the three female leads are better than most horror films like this there s 2 scenes that may cause an unexpected jump young small children are use to crawl through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines when one does collapse causing a cave in all the children die becoming zombies the adults in the mine stay dead no reasons are given as why the children become flesh eaters when still alive they looked terrified before the cave in innocent so they must become enraged at any adult which exploited them int he mines only reason that come to mind a mother and her 2 daughters move into a house near the mine along with a land devoloper who wants to build a resort and another of those creepy people who seem to know exactly what s going on yet no one believes him nothing new here you re usual clich√©s predictable a lot of negatives for this film very few positives 
274,natalie wood portrays courtney patterson a polio disabled songwriter who attempts to avoid being victimized as a result of involvement in her first love affair with her partner being attorney marcus simon played tepidly by wood s real life husband robert wagner the film is cut heavily but the majority of the remaining scenes shows a very weak hand from the director who permits wagner to consistently somnambulate laying waste to a solid and nuanced performance from wood who also proffers a fine soprano the script is somewhat trite but the persistent nature of wagner s dramatic shortcoming is unfortunately in place throughout as he is given a free hand to impose his desultory stare at wood which must be discouraging to an actress the progression of their relationship is erratically presented and this coupled with choppy editing leads the viewer to be less than assured as to what is transpiring motivation being almost completely ignored in the writing although largely undistinguished the cinematography shines during one brief scene when wood is placed in a patio and following the sound of a closing door remains at the center while the camera s eye steadily pulls away demonstrating her helplessness and frailty more controlled direction would have allowed the performers even the limp wagner to scale their acting along the lines of an engaging relationship as it was released there is for the most part an immense lack of commitment 
756,the brilliance of this film lies not in the filmmaking process which is a conventional but executed intertwining tale of the lies of three servicemen post wwii but in the fact that this story was told at all samuel goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands an alcoholic and an underachiever 
460,i always look forward to this movie when its on tv have to get the dvd i guess the range of different types of people is great it says to me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough my favorite character must be mr aoki he is so quirky but so full of emotions it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to blackpool would make for the perfect sequel if they had but i guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened a very simple and innocent story he stays loyal to his wife and daughter i haven t seen the hollywood remake not sure if i want to i don t really enjoy jennifer lopez i think richard gere more matches the original than lopez i have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent 
842,this film was such a mess i actually reimbursed my friends who i dragged to see it the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot i m sure that this film was meant to be campy but the approach was so heavy handed and self reflexive it turned out really flat judd nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton who i feel embarrassed for this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor a freak accident alters nelson s career course and mayhem ensues the attempts at humor were corny predictable and often base and tasteless wayne newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing comedically or otherwise overall it s a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon at least you could laugh at plan 9 from outer space this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film one of the all time worst bombs you ll ever witness 
307,this movie seems to start in the middle introduces peripheral players as if they were significant and presents main characters without any substance and paper thin and or impenetrable back stories almost nobody has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film the plot rambles and ultimately goes nowhere the dialogue is clunky and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best from his actors it almost feels like there s a first half of this movie but it never got made we re told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over new york city and that central park has inexplicably become an arctic wasteland yet none of this seems to have caused much of a stir amongst the general population and is only of minimal concern to the government we re presented with the evil corporation in eugenics but that s really just a convenient conceit to populate the universe with a couple power tripping minions the whole eugenics is bad double entendre is heavy handed and never really pans out here we re supposed to care about the central characters but we never learn enough about them to know why so much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it comes off as a 1 hour 40 minute fatalistic rationalization for rape on the ground breaking digitally animated world created here all i can say is that at about the same time as this film was made several other directors did the same thing with more seamless and believable results after spending the time to watch this film the most burning question left in my mind was so what 
334,it s a weekend i ve been watched this funny film and i really like it all the kids are cute who remind me of my own childhood with those stupid thinking it s a real entertaining movie for a group of families at weekend night which could make lots of memories and laughters kid s humor always work nice acting as well simple story but cool shooting nice job for directer to find the kid s way when it comes to the kid movie i think of 12 and holding another one this year but differed aspect to the kid s world which is real and cruel awesome work h2efw focuses on the happy side of childhood which every kid and family need p s twitch i think is the voice of nemo from finding nemo 
530,nothing about this movie is any good it s a formulaic predictable romantic comedy geared to make females force their significant others to watch in other words it s a predictable chic flick that is neither comedic or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable if you like watching the same thing over and over then this movie will fit just perfect i was also forced to watch this with my g f at the time and it s no surprise we are no longer together i enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors nothing good to say about this movie the title says it all 1 10 one b c i can t give it a zero 
404,is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant life spanning testimonial of spring summer fall winter and spring the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite nearly silent heartbreaking longing of 3 iron the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of the coast guard and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all characters and viewers alike to experience redemption in samaritan girl i just cannot seem to find him in this film oh sure kim s nature motif is still present the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters yes it s kim ki duk all right kim even describes the film as beautiful in an interview included in the dvd s special features but i m not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation what is beautiful about angry potty mouthed prostitutes lustful violent and potty mouthed fishermen a covetous mute merchant explicit animal torture sequences of self mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material it has been favorably compared to audition by japanese director takashi miike much to kim s satisfaction but aside from some astonishingly good performances especially given what they had to work with by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk i find little reason to recommend this film i have not seen audition but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of the isle its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic its sex is not pornographic but passionless and masochistic characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot its point is either non existent or i will admit lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand the only beauty is in the cinematography which is classic kim fog shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake mountainous terrain dominating the background and an imaginative and playful use of color at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room some touches like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes are intriguing but as a film this effort is downright confusing and in the end offensive to the senses not necessarily to sensibilities one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film making in the trash heap of his past for we know he is capable of so much more 
96,it s one of my favorites tv series a wonderful cast great screenplay and a out siding plot watching the routine of the kyle family is grantee of great moments of humor and great comedy performers let s see damon wayans no commentaries he s one of the bests today se has a perfect timing and always get the point of the joke tisha campbell her s paranoid and sentimental jay is just wonderful to see george o gore ii perfect for the paper it s impossible to imagine someone else as the adorable and dumb junior jennifer nicole freeman the egocentric claire found the perfect actress beautiful talented parker mckeena posey impossible to not fall in love for her noah grey cabey this boy have future i m sure of it i get very sad when it ends but this show will be in my mind forever michael jay claire junior kadie we love you 
394,for a while it seemed like this show was on 24 7 then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most vapid and conceited people who have ever been filmed all the other comments have captured the essence of these two selfish haggish airheads perfectly not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has said i doubt these two ladies have souls and more than likely they made some kind of faustian bargain in order to get their lizardly snouts on a television series may the fates protect the human race from any more exposure to the ghastly girls 
569,1940 a visit to the lodz ghetto in nazi occupied poland recorded by a german cameramen with the naive co operation of the jewish community is combined with archival footage clips from international newsreels and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the world s jews as swindlers and parasites this documentary interprets jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti semitism and nazi ideology a candid cinematically unique expression of racial hatred i personally find this film frightening and highly offensive one can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again 
674,people who know me say i have a weakness for animated films to be fair those people are half right my actual weakness is for exceptionally well done animated films such as this vintage family flick from max and david fleischer you may be thinking to yourself well if it s so great why haven t i heard of it fair question this movie was released the same week as the attacks on pearl harbor the unavoidably bad timing caused the film to sink into relative obscurity things are looking up though because it has finally been released on dvd under the title bugville it s funny that the film went through all this because it kind of mirrors the actual plot although some people claim that the movie is trying to send an environmental message ugh i personally think that the movie s main idea is perseverance through adversity and hard times after all the country had barely pulled out of the depression at the time our grasshopper hero hoppity desperately wants to help his endangered community problem each time he tries whether through the ill will of others or through simple bad luck he fails miserably and slowly begins to earn the disdain of the very people he s trying to save although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook he occasionally breaks down and it s only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets back on his feet and fights the good fight just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done no one is really self sufficient okay you re saying it has a good message two actually does that really make it exceptionally well done my answer partially it s not just the message that makes this movie special it s the characterization this is one of those films where you can just see the personality of each cast member in their animation you almost don t even need the spoken lines a good way to sum it all up is energetic or lively a lot of movies have used the selling point lovable cast of characters whenever i hear that line it always makes me think of this movie case in point the bad guys swat the fly and smack the mosquito many movies have lovable villains but i don t think you ll find any as entertaining or endearing as these fellows forget that 3 stooges cartoon from the 60s swat and smack are the closest thing to an animated version of moe and curly but sadly not larry that you ll ever find virtually all of the funniest moments somehow involve this gruesome twosome yeah they re rotten no goodniks but you still care about them that s the kind of power you only see from a really talented writer director and crew the movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes native americans and chinese i don t think they were intended to be malicious but they re there regardless they didn t bother me but it d be pretty unfair of me not to warn someone who potentially would be bothered by them so if you share my weakness and i think you do give this one a go 
951,i was recommended this movie by one of my film making friends and was therefore expecting something good sadly i was very disappointed by the first half ah a movie about a wimp taking revenge on their a hole boss how original and watched the second half on fast forward hoping to find something that would justify the 45 odd minutes i d already wasted but all i got was the shock ending the basic problem is that this is a movie which seems unable to decide what it wants to say and says whatever it does say hard to tell what that is badly great acting does not save a bad script full of characters i can t care about now maybe if i didn t moonlight in the movie industry i d be shocked to discover the dumb politics and exploitation going on behind the screen but as it is my feelings are as summed up above ho hum 2 10 would have been 1 10 if it weren t for the acting and the paper cut scene 
345, ghost of dragstrip hollow was one of the many 50s movies about hot rodding teens encountering the supernatural in this case the teens can t pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted with nowhere else to go they decide on an apparently haunted house as you may have guessed once they arrive some weird things start happening and there s a twist at the end there s nothing in this movie that you haven t seen in other movies but it s nice entertainment nonetheless my favorite character was the foul mouthed parrot well let me rephrase that he didn t talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie but he said things that we don t expect out of a bird the movie s pure hokum but harmless 
893,as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known the two leads always have to get together late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together a clue was given right from the start but you ll never realize it until the end it s a simple hook but it works it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground but takes a fresh spin when ever possible i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations it s a postcard of ny also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it so if you like a good old fashion romantic movie then this is for you 
335,film follows a bunch of students in the nyc high school of the performing arts there s coco irene cara a black singer who will make it to the top despite everything she s helped by bruno lee curren a white musician then there s doris maureen teefy who wants to be an actress but she s shy and scared she becomes friends with motgomery paul mccrane purportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by raul barry miller then there s leroy gene anthony ray who sadly died in 2003 who s homeless and a great dancer but can t read then there s various teachers albert hague anne meara stand out trying to teach the kids the songs are great the title tune and out here on my own were nominated for best song fame won the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent but this film misses the boat in the drama department many plot lines are brought up and completely left open ended by the end of the movie why did coco do a porno did doris and raul remain together afterwords did either make it how about montgomery what happened to him and did leroy ever graduate and how there are too many long speeches raul has two and moments that just lead to nothing i m assuming there were cuts in the script i can t believe the movie just left all this open still it s worth seeing for the acting and again the music there s basically not one bad song and the dances go full force and at one point stop traffic literally my favorites are fame out here and i sing the body electric which is a great closing song so i recommend it but can only give it a 7 the script really needed to tie up loose ends and it didn t trivia they wanted to shot this film at the actual school for performing arts but couldn t get permission the dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film that is true there is a lot of foul language but that s how high school kids talk avoid the tv version which abysmally overdubs it 
788,i love b movies but i like to be aware from the beginning that i m watching one i can t believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and predators so bad aliens and predator are awesome this movie made a big joke out of them the creators didn t take this movie seriously at all i am throughly disappointed in how the strauss jerks handled this film they made a mockery of amazing characters it s like they were trying to be serious in the beginning then their writers got high and gave up almost nothing was continuous the main characters were awful and were not aliens or predators i am so ridiculously sad that no one takes alien and predators seriously anymore these characters are icons of american pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films they should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves
230,when i played the first soul calibur on dreamcast i thought it was great when i played the second i was hooked and finally when soul calibur iii was released i bought a playstation 2 and the game this can really keep you up for hours with a huge amount of characters loads of unlockable content and not to mention a great fighting system this really is the greatest fighting game to date the games strong points is foremost the vs gameplay were two human players battle each other either playing as one of the main characters or as a created and customized character the create character option is vast and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations the only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the fighting style grieve edge only kicks has to wear those ridiculous shoes this is absolutely the greatest fighting game one could wish for now i m just hoping the planned movie won t be crap 
397,there s no shortage of bad dialogue in david and bathsheba i was quite a hand with a slingshot the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy full marks to dennis hooey for delivering that one with a straight face go and sit with the concubines and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan whatever you say he even tries the old my kingdom doesn t understand me routine on desperate housewife bathsheba at one point so it s probably a tribute to henry king s direction that the film isn t at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide maybe it s the censor baiting nature of the plot a married man kills a femme fatale s husband and gets away with it but king brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in phillip dunne s script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum this is the conflicted david on the downhill slope abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands and the film doesn t back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives unlike king david which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting saul david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close up when visiting the site of saul and jonathan s death gregory peck s performance grows in stature as david shrinks susan hayward is pure hollywood pro raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet why be naturalistic when you ve got a voice that makes the very heavens quake and kieron moore s uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can t exactly blame david for putting him in harm s way but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesn t allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s 50s biblical epics fox s new dvd is a good transfer including an incredibly hokey candid behind the scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film s sole battle scene 
66,jessica is a young virginal and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch jessica is also a powerful psychic capable of dowsing retro cognition precognition and esp when young and handsome gordon hawthorne comes to visit he is instantly skeptical of jessica s powers until her skills uncover a lost wristwatch and unearth an ancient treasure chest however the treasure chest holds the severed head of a centuries dead satanist named gideon drew whose powers are far stronger than jessica s despite her warnings of the evil in their midst drew manages to mentally enslave everyone unfortunate to make eye contact with him but drew wants jessica most of all he needs her dowsing skills to unearth his body so that he can rise from the dead and rule over the human race will jessica s powerful fleur de lis combined with gordon s love ward the ancient evil off before it can destroy them all this isn t a very interesting movie it certainly could have been the basic story is interesting and imaginative but the acting is leaden and the whole thing moves much too slowly to hold interest jessica is also too innocent almost annoyingly so and gordon her love interest is wooden stiff and totally emotionless none of the characters are very likable and the low budget is painfully obvious a rushed ending also doesn t help matters avoid unless it s the mst3k version 
995,this movie turned out to be pretty much what i expected of course it s sappy of course it s predictable we all know the fairytale but knowing that when you go to watch it it s enjoyable enough to watch it was funny and sweet i did find it annoying that they showed geeks as either kids who didn t wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore t shirts about math i was an outcast in high school and i didn t do these things it goes much deeper than that having to do with many things some of that being how much money your family has how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how mean you are willing to be to other kids anyway i won t get into it i don t agree with other opinions that drew isn t convincing as a geek with braces no make up and unwashed hair i don t think too many people would be drooling over her and even when she goes back to high school and sheds those things she s still wearing the wrong clothes wrong hair and has the wrong attitude to be considered cool and her other geek friend may be beautiful but it doesn t matter where i come from you can still be an outcast and be beautiful inside and out 
169,viewed this great classic film of greta garbo and thought her performance was excellent however the german film version which had english captions was her greatest performance greta garbo even mentioned to the press that the german film was her favorite where she had to make the change from silent films to sound greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films this story was very sad because greta garbo anna christie ninotchka 39 was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain there were many scenes of old nyc the brooklyn bridge coney island and the sky line of manhattan charles bickford matt burke days of wine roses 62 a classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role 
275,aussie shakespeare for 18 24 set with blood blood and more blood and good dose of nudity this will not be for every one on may levels to violent for some too cheap for most done on low budget they try and do there best but it only works sporadically and this macbeth just seem to be lacking its just not compelling although there is some good acting on the part of most you don t get into there heads especially mecbeths the best performance came from gary sweet and the strangest mick molly if your into shakespeare then see it but if you like your cheese mature you will love it it not a bad film but it not that good either sam peckenpah would of loved it that is if it was filmed as a western i was expecting a lot from this as i loved romper stomper but this is was a vacant effort 
471,i was excited about this movie after reading other reviews what a disappointment there are so many ways that this movie is bad the computer graphics were lacking to say the least i found the acting stiff and unbelievable watch the sand as the lost e pods what an original name are found where did all the tracks come from i immediately recognized portions similar to other movies ie alien pitch black come on one huge ship to transport one prisoner and what is with the prisoner does he speak can he speak i kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together but it never came if this movie was made on a low budget it shows the only part of the movie i liked was when it finally ended i don t mean that i liked the ending i didn t i just liked the fact that it was over a trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable in my opinion don t waste your time on this one 
73,yet again i appear to be the only person on planet earth who is capable of criticizing japanese films made before 1970 fires on the plain 1959 is another in the seemingly endless line of classics that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason as much as i love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film it s still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of masterpiece what i find truly ironic is that fans of derivative classics like fires on the plain focus so much on inside the box movie making orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting acting camera work etc yet it always seems like the most highly revered classics are most deficient in these very standards for example one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial most surprisingly the very first scene in fires on the plain uses this indolent tactic to the extreme after a funny head slap the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer why can t you grasp the situation we landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at tacloban we lost two thirds of our men our artillery was sunk in transit we tried to reach burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible the enemy s counterattack forced a fanout across the valley you know that so why exactly is one character telling another character something he already knows oh yeah that s right the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information you see a quality film would actually show these events happening or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events heck even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired here such instances of poor quality movie making are littered throughout fires on the plain to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles for example the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in japanese garb instead of doing the natural thing like oh i don t know giving a depressed mannerism the character blurts out japanese soldiers thanks buddy but i could have figured that one out for myself even worse this movie is saturated with over dramatic ploys the most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots picture this a soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots one would think that such a find is utterly useless but it turns out that the soldier s boots are in even worse condition so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his super worn boots behind fine i get the point the soldiers are in rough shape a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with the scene is ridiculous but i was ready to let it go until the second soldier arrives you see he finds the previous soldier s super worn boots and notices get ready cause here it comes that his boots are super duper worn boots lucky man he picks up the super worn boots and leaves his super duper worn boots behind but you see that s not all because the third soldier then arrives he finds the previous soldiers super duper worn boots and inspects them along with his own super duper worn boots since both pairs suck he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot at this point i was ready to throw my television through my living room window the heavy handedness overdramaticism and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film making it s super duper bad film making there are a number of similar completely stupid moments to be had like the time when the lead character asks someone hey are you dead like the guy is going to answer yes if he actually kicked the bucket i ll also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction i laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid goofy expression on his face the fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an imdb average rating of 8 4 while a certifiable masterpiece like a tale of two sisters 2003 only gets a 7 5 is the height of mass stupidity and to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that atots doesn t make sense well not every movie can have completely outrageous super duper worn boots on its side 
138,when carol vanessa hidalgo starts looking into her brother s death she begins to suspect something more sinister than natural causes the closer she gets to the truth the more of a threat she becomes to her sister in law fiona helga line and the rest of the local satanists they ll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways if you re into sleazy satanic themed movies black candles has a lot to offer the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft core sex one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed unfortunately all the sleaze in the world can t save black candles most of the movie is a total bore other than the one scene i ve already mentioned the numerous sex scenes aren t shocking and certainly aren t sexy the acting is spotty at best even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance the plot really doesn t matter its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together i m only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror black candles comes off as amateurish 3 10 is about the best i can do 
621,although this film has had a lot of praise i personally found it boring there are some nice brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable but the story of how they interrelate even if very unusual by our standards is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first as the tolerance of the various men is stretched we see their characters develop the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting it is a rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland far from the city but hardly exciting enough to keep one s eyes open for 
874,you gotta love the spaghetti western universe the vision of a west where good guys get shot point blank with no warning cartoonish villains chew the scenery in extreme close ups and the anti hero walks away from the girl in the end a lot of people call corbucci s films depressing i find that a bit dodgy as far as descriptions go i think bleak and unforgiving are more apt mostly because depressing suggests a level of sentimentality almost every eurowestern director ignored in favour of painting characters in broad strokes gli specialisti must be seen in all its widescreen glory before it can take its proper place in the sergio corbucci canon it s a beautiful movie and it makes sense that corbucci wanted to blow off some steam with companeros after the unremitting one two punch of the great silence and this although he would later revert back to his usual tricks with the foulmouthed sonny and jed there s still a certain amount of caricature that detracts from the overall grimness of the movie imo it hurts more than does any good to have a needless inclusion of three kids dressed like hippies skulking around town in search of gold and trouble and it hurts to have mario adorf playing mexican one handed bandit el diablo as over the top as he always plays his characters those minor gripes aside there s more than enough here to wet the palate of the spaghetti aficionado shootouts galore the population of an entire town reduced to crawling naked in the dirt the typical iconic badassitude of the laconic antihero played by johnny halliday the moral bankruptcy of almost every character in the movie corbucci might never receive the acclaim of the more famous sergio or the american patriarchs of the genre but you and i know that s a gross injustice for a very talented director his dynamic shot selection in depth staging with objects sticking close to the camera and receding in the background his flair for quick pacing and feverish energy in moving a story that wasn t always all that along the way he photographs open spaces everything in his work makes me sure that if corbucci was american and had emerged 15 years later along with mann and hawks the cahiers du cinema critics would have lauded him as an auteur worthy of serious critical consideration 
430,i will keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely warrants a mention zombie 90 is one of the worst films ever made right up there with schnaas other horrible zombie entry zombie doom aka violent sh t 3 these films suck so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot i somehow managed barely to sit through zombie doom but zombie 90 is so horribly inept even when compared to schnaas other horrible film that i had to fast forward through everything after the first 10 minutes zero acting skills inept gore horrible camcorder style camera work ridiculous dubbing it just goes on and on i really can t find a single thing redeeming about this garbage and i can usually find something redeeming in just about any film this truly is one of the worst films ever made you ve been warned 1 10
7,a beautiful reflection of life s desperation and misdirection of finding love tragic while at the same time absurdly entertaining most people do not give this film a chance ignorance just a mere reflection in itself until next time 
562,before i see on this film i see a lot of comments which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad what i really want to point out is the acting on woody harrelson behalf he may not be in many parts of the film but when he appears or even the intro i was astonished by will smith s and woody harrelson message they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on i am not a very sentimental person i believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it but a act to show redemption there is not many films that in my point of view can show this this is one of them that can i agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of suicide is a downfall however i do not believe that is the message the film is trying to send but sacrifice a bit to the extreme but that is the message in my opinion this film has potential the acting it is worth every penny the script is unbelievable from a person that doesn t really like watching drama films if you like drama this is a must go watch 
693,it has been some years since i saw this but remember it and would like to see it again it kind of became a therapy for me with a personal experience of my own a thirty five year old man laments over a high school baseball game in which he missed the ball and his team lost he thinks about it 20 years later if only i d hit that ball and how his life would be better because of it then he gets a chance to find out and gets a little more than he bargained for it reminds me so much of when i was in high school i twice tried out for our drill dance team and didn t make it this team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school if you were on it you were all that i didn t try out till my last two years of hs and after the second time i took it really hard i d hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise and that caused me to not make it that was in 1987 through the years even now sometimes i think if only i hadn t hit my leg i would ve never worn those stupid tights now i don t sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had i made it but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past who knows it could have changed the course of events to the point that i wouldn t have met my son s father i would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change be careful what you wish for 
511,the big bad swim has a low budget indie feel about it so many times i start to watch independent films that have had really good reviews only to find out they are pretentious crud voted for by people who are so blinded by the idea of the film and its potential to be provocative that they forget that film is a form of entertainment first and foremost i do not know if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor if it does then i missed it from the get go bbs felt right it was easy and warm and human there were no major dramas or meaningful insights i just connected with the characters straight off and when as with all good films the end came around i felt sadness at the loss of that connection if you are looking for something big or fast or insightful look elsewhere look for a film trying to deliver more than it can bbs delivers a solid enjoyable real experience and i felt rewarded and satiated having watched it 
729, warning spoilers ahead the writers of this story knew these men very well the actors likewise portrayed them very well the result is that by the end of the film you feel like you re actually watching john lennon and paul mccartney the expected tensions are there especially in the awkward first moments but as the two begin to loosen up the old camaraderie that made the beatles work so well begins to show through the bitterness is still there and interrupts at times but by the time john gets the idea to take lorne michaels up on his offer to pay the beatles the gag sum of 3000 to appear on saturday night live the two could be the same boyish pranksters that terrorized liverpool together as teens and survived playing the rough nightclubs of hamburg to rise to superstardom but in the end this wonderful fantasy grounds us gently we are reminded why a beatles reunion was most likely never possible even before lennon s assassination the two driving forces of the group outgrew each other 
996,from time to time it s very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even before in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the aristocrats rule the world and that s what happens in the love light the first film directed by dame france marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter better for her certainly because her career as a film director doesn t impress this german count the film tells the story of dame angela carlotti dame mary pickford a merry italian girl who lives surrounded by a picturesque squalor an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes aristocrats prefers to live surrounded by picturesque luxury she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is declared and dame angela s two brothers enlist and in the next reel both are dead but destiny is even crueller and dame angela meanwhile falls in love with a german and to make things worse she doesn t know that her teutonic sweetie is a spy and that the light signals that she sends to him every night from the lighthouse she maintains thinking that is a love signal don t mean ich liebe dich but sink any damn italian boat at sea fortunately for dame angela pretty soon her sweetie german spy will be found by the neighbours in her house in which she was hiding him a not strange fact indeed because it is not an easy task for a german to go unnoticed but the german spy will prefer to die before being captured by those italians from that german love a half teutonic baby will born the wicked destiny at full speed but a greedy neighbour who has a particular idea of motherhood will carry away her son with the consent of a catholic nun who has taken the council of trent to extremes a fact that will put dame angela at the verge of insanity but meanwhile dame angela s secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally dame angela s sorrowful life will improve a tremendous mistake because destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind but as they say in germany it may be a blessing in disguise and finally dame angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind sweetie in a poor italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people as this german count said before it was much better for dame frances marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter because as can be seen in the love light she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories ja wohl but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of dame pickford to involve the audience with her many disgraces the nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only dame pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances and now if you ll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must send morse signals from the schloss north tower to one of his teutonic rich heiress 
535,okay this movie fine like i said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch it s about two boys mac and sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when mac akshay kumar starts dating with 3 air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely but mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses there s garam masala at every step of the movie songs rock but somethings lacking the comedy s not up to the mark and deserves an award its nice but not all that excellent some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it didn t deserve that many laughs but of course everyone s opinion is different so if you wanna watch the movie you re welcome to do so 
711,a young couple father ben solid charles bateman wife nicky the lovely ahna capri and their daughter kt the cute geri reischl of i dismember mama fame find themselves trapped in a small california desert town populated by hysterical lunatics worse yet there s a pernicious satanic cult that s been abducting little children for their own diabolical purposes director bernard mceveety working from an offbeat and inspired script by william welch and l q jones devil times five director sean macgregor came up with the bizarre story relates the compellingly oddball plot at a slow yet steady pace and ably creates a creepy edgy mysterious ooga booga atmosphere strother martin delivers a wonderfully wicked and robust performance as doc duncan who s the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect the top rate cast of excellent character actors qualifies as a substantial asset jones as gruff no nonsense sheriff hillsboro alvy moore as friendly local toby and charles robinson as a shrewd fiercely devout priest jack john arthur morrill s bright polished widescreen cinematography jamie mendoza nava s spooky score and the wild rousing climactic black mass ritual are all likewise up to speed the idea of having toys come to murderous life is simply ingenious the opening scene with a toy tank coming real and crushing a family in their car is truly jolting nice eerily ambiguous ending too a pleasingly idiosyncratic and under appreciated winner 
212,for the most part michael is a disaster ten minutes of charm and ninety s worth of missteps travolta and macdowell do their best frequently rising above nora ephron s numbingly banal script but the film moves like a snail and even within its fantasy context the characters behave implausibly on a regular basis reporters who routinely let the story of a lifetime an apparent angel living on earth out of their sight someone forgot to tell romantic comedy maestro ephron that william hurt brilliant in so many other films is no tom hanks the movie s climax redefines the word contrived ephron may be shooting for heaven here but unfortunately michael is a long long ride through cinema heck 
105,even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it s still an awful film if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke first off jeroen krabb√© is i guess the poor man s gerard depardieu naturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the iron mask three musketeer one otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabb√© is worse than that the poor man s box office poison really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised if the 4th man is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisie what am i saying it isn t let s just say hypothetically if it was supposed to be it wasn t sharp enough satire is a tricky thing if it isn t sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead i think that is what happened the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel film very sharp satire potential spoiler alert really the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabb√© s character works so so hard to attain do you even care is it funny since mr voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control though i m guessing he didn t cast jeroen krabb√© because he s the worst actor and every character he s played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass except he s incompetent at it so it becomes like a weird caricature do you think mr voerhoven did that on purpose and jeroen krabb√© is the butt of the joke as well i just don t see it so you understand the dilemma i m faced with here right it is the worst film ever because he s supposed to be a good director so there is some kind of dupery involved i knew patch adams was horrible without even seeing it do not be duped by the 4th man s deceptively alluring packaging or mr voerhoven s reputation as a good director etc etc 
726,i love this show it s clever and very well acted david morse and andre braugher have great chemistry the writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief after every new episode i m always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is my only complaint would be donna murphy s absence at this point in the second season as david morse ex wife heather she added such character to the show i think this show is a credit to the crime drama genre with that said i can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique 
712,i have always been a fan of bottom grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states the chemistry between rik and ade is always genius and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness and was utterly disappointed by the end the first 3 4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed sorry ade but with some utterly brilliant moments unfortunately these laugh out loud moments make you realize how less than brilliant the rest of the movie is the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous the end of the movie the green scenes for those of you who ve seen it was perhaps the worst ending i ve seen in the past decade honestly it was one joke repeated about thirty times followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense which didn t bother me and wasn t funny which did to sum up i was sorely disappointed by this movie i shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it to retain the fondest memories that i can but i have to warn you if you re about to overpay for your ntsc conversion tape from the local importer don t there are far better things to spend your money on 
822,for a no budget movie this thing rocks i don t know if america s gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really non hollywood the actors and music rocked the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up whooo whooo i ve seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think i ve seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it rocked luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors 
486,what is this a low budget sex comedy anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain they could come up with a better idea i mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s and people like them this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one you can t let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing he ll never want to go to spain this should be rated r because only people 35 seem to laugh watching s i m truly disappointed maybe i don t like gays which is quite an important part of the movie foreign humor is awful in films except kusturica stick with doing dramas if you want a new comedy try talladega nights
741,now i don t hate cheap movies i just don t see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad s camcorder if i rent a movie i want it to be a movie not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv tapes maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great and it wasn t maybe i hate it because it s cheap has the dumbest plot ever the most unrealistic characters ever and the really really really worst showdown in the history of films ever even tom savini can t save this seriously this one is a complete waste of time 
548,this movie was ridiculous from the start let me save you all time from watching this movie a woman who sells corn liquor to the locals takes in her cousin or nephew and he convinces her to open a caf√© downstairs from her home she does and she and the cousin become close there is a scene later where she is locking lips with him later the woman finds out an old boyfriend is coming back from jail and its tense between them leading to a down and out fist fight in the caf√© the woman s cousin nephew is enamored by the man the ending was awful the story was awful and if i could get back the time wasted on this movie i would appreciate it a definite skip 
375,i agree that this film was spectacular the way in which jamie foxx captured not only the impression of ray charles but the essence of ray charles really made the film his life made a great story and it is good that it is finally being told i also found a great interview with jamie foxx about this role by ernie manouse from innerviews on kuht houston channel 8 the link is http video google com videoplay docid 3001837218936089620 q innerviews jamie foxx hl en i encourage everyone to check it out as it gives in depth looks into what went into his role and his personal feelings about ray charles the only problem i might cite with the film is that the shotting style was rather bland at times but in the end i think it helped make the story more realistic and keep the focus on the person ray charles rather than the film ray 
399,i watched deadly voyage because david suchet was in it after enjoying him in the poirot series and joss ackland is always worth watching so i went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film alas it was not to be i won t bother critiquing the performances the pacing the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film others here have already given their opinions on those elements the only thing i want to address is the film s message since it proclaims in the intro that it s based upon a true story and therein hangs the film s supposed importance deadly voyage primarily focuses upon an impoverished black african man named kingsley who wants to move to the us because he believes that he can make money there nothing more nothing less his motivation is utterly selfish of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in ghana so he really just created his own problem to that end kingsley decides to stow away aboard a russian freighter bound for new york in the process of doing this he faces harsh conditions racist crew members and other challenges but this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic why should the audience be expected to care about kingsley simply because he has a goal goals aren t such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say the goal of the ship s captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child kingsley s goal is illegal in the eyes of the us government it is also illegal in that it steals from the russian shipping company if he makes it to the us it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into and if he gets caught the shipping company will be fined 45 000 i doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else they re clearly just out for their own gain he could ve spent the 1 000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film for legal passage to the us and applied for residency and a work permit instead he takes the illegal and dangerous route so since kingsley s voyage is illegal selfish and cannot be ethically justified why should we care about him or his ordeal simply because he faces challenges why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the russian shipping company getting to new york without stowaways because he s black and the shipping company is white the reason seems to be because danny glover the film s executive producer and others involved want us to root for kingsley as if he s a hero on some sort of noble voyage but once you accept that illegal immigration theft and a fool s mission aren t noble at all you can t really care about him before anyone plays the race card i assure you that i would ve felt the same no matter what ethnicity nationality the involved parties were imagine if a british person decided to stow away in a train headed for bhutan sneak across the border and collect unwanted buddhist antiquities to bring back to britain to sell how much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate very little i d bet so why should we feel different for kingley because he s black because he s poor by american standards the filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means and that a shipping company being fined 45 000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the us than he could ve if he had just stayed in his own home country i didn t buy it for a minute 
662,all movies that contain goofy sound effects should be shot if there is one thing i hate it s gotta be the use of a whoop whoop whoo when somebody gets hit one the head the only movies i have seen to do this is ghoulies iv and hobgoblins when they are in the bar and pixie is hitting the guy in the red suit with a beer bottle or rather fanning him with a beer bottle because she never really hits him with it yes ghoulies iv does suck but i have to wonder did they mean to not make the so called ghoulies mouths move when they supposedly talked their faces are almost as static as the masks used in trolls 2 hell i can make a better mask out of construction paper some rubber cement and a handful of glitter this sucked 
847,i like movies about ufos which is why i recently decided to rewatch eyes behind the stars after seeing it when i was a kid back in the late 1970s and now i m compelled to write a review about it because i m afraid i ll start forgetting everything about it fast you see even though ebts ain t bad it s very dull and nondescript the story is sorta interesting but flat the actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing the fx are terribly amateurish but i can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling which unfortunately this one ain t also there s very little violence and there s no nudity whatsoever which makes this 1970s italian sci fi opus a true oddity because if there s one thing that distinguishes italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade it s the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them oddly enough because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements ebts stands out from the rest of the pact i don t know if this can be seen as a compliment though personally i can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but i think ebts needed more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry and the special effects aren t that special the story itself is actually interesting it s a combo of the x files and antonioni s blowup a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country the aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth the problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographer s apartment this taking place just before she s to be abducted herself the man takes some of the negatives and leaves with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives the whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives the majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue in the spy vs spy variety the ufo element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war mcguffin but as dull as eyes behind the stars is it does resemble the x files a lot i wonder if chris carter saw this movie anyway the best thing in ebts are the pov shots which are creepy and effective but the rest is almost completely forgettable including the goofy looking aliens even though i ve been mostly negative about this film i sorta cherish it nonetheless i still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when i saw it as a kid and i own the video the film could have been so much more if it had been done properly oh well 
12,mary haines meg ryan a rich woman discovers her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman eva mendes she doesn t know what to do and friends sylvia fowler annette bening edie cohen debra messing and alex fisher jad pinkett smith try to help ok there was no reason to redo the 1939 movie that s a true classic and doesn t need to be updated and redone naturally it was done this has gotten some of the worst reviews i ve ever seen for a motion picture i love the original and have seen it many times i was constantly comparing it to that now this isn t a classic but it s not that bad minor spoilers first the bad the story is old and was badly updated really a man cheating on his wife is hardly shocking today meg ryan a wonderful actress is pretty terrible here her face seems unable to change expression i couldn t believe how bad some of her scenes came over eva mendes is bad too but it s not entirely her fault her role is badly written and she has to compete with joan crawford from the original smith s character a tough lesbian goes to pieces in an operating room it is funny but it s showing that a strong woman instantly goes to pieces when confronting an emergency also the script inserts some clumsy passages where ryan talks to her daughter about being yourself in those moments it seems more like a lifetime movie than anything else now the good this movie retains the originals decision to never show a man on screen this movie is about and for women men aren t needed btw i m a man bening is just great as fowler whenever she s on screen the movie makes a great leap also smith is just wonderful she doesn t overplay or underplay her lesbian character too much messing is good too but she s not in this much bette midler is just hysterical in a small role and cloris leachman pulls off the nothing role of a housekeeper the direction is good too especially during a fashion show sequence i heard director diane english purportedly had a lot of trouble directing her first full length movie but it doesn t show in the final product also there are some clever references to the original mostly certain lines that were inserted with no fuss i saw this in an audience full of women there were a few guys but not many and they loved it the movie ends on an operating room sequence that had everybody howling so this wasn t needed but it s not the disaster people are saying it is also people are saying we don t need a movie with all women well why not i see plenty of movies with all guys in the cast and no one complains about that ignore the complaints and bad reviews and see this with a better performance by ryan i might have given this an 8 or 9 but as it is i can only give it a 7 
721,so so thriller starring brad pitt and juliette lewis who join david duchovny and michelle forbes on a road trip out west the latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book pitt s a serial killer on the lam unbeknownst to dave and juliette is his poor not all there companion this is a good cast and the story moves along but pitt isn t belivably scary as a serial killer although it is one of his better earlier roles the best thing is here is michelle forbes who always manages to shine whether in her roles on homicide life on the street or in the brief series wonderland vote 6
813,well i have to say this movie was probably the funniest movie i have seen all year and i don t exactly mean that in a good way this is probably the most pathetic movie i have seen in a while and yet that s what makes it so hilarious you can tell these people are really trying to act unfortunately for them they aren t doing such a good job making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny aaron carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic this movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying this movie is so bad it s actually good i would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh 
320,i don t watch much porn but i love porn stars and i love gory movies so when i heard about a porn star gore movie i was really excited of course that was years ago and when i heard about all the trouble with making and finishing the movie i never thought i d actually get to see it but i did and i m not ashamed to admit i loved it even with all its flaws first the flaws the story is set in ireland and is called samhain but the story it seemed to want to tell is about the sawney beane clan from scotland so why not just set it there and skip the third grade report about samhain irish immigrants halloween also it breaks its own rules by stating that you re safe on the trails but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere it s never clear how many cannibals we re dealing with there s a big stone castle that s obviously ancient yet no one s noticed it before the self conscious horror film references are annoying and so are the characters the heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she never met the ending makes no sense so what works the gore sure i would have liked more but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that wasn t afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie two murders are waay over the top and taylor hayes has a nice disgusting scene the two wild murders are even given extended shots on the dvd i ve always been of the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and evil breed reinforced that 
817,perhaps it s about time we declare 2007 to be the international year of the cinematic crocodile the ridiculous primeval came first about a croc named gustave ruling the swamps in burundi then there was lake placid 2 a low profiled and made for tv sequel to a forgettable original thirdly there s this incredibly derivative and soporific piece of aussie horror and finally i have yet to see the promising rogue the last one is likely to be the best considering the involvement of the upcoming aussie horror talent greg mclean wolf creek black water certainly isn t a complete waste of time and film but it s another pretty pointless survival flick that confuses real life agony with horror pardon my bluntness especially since i honestly feel sorry for the people who went through this ordeal but depicting three characters sitting in a tree and whining for more than a full hour is not my idea of sheer suspense three young people travel through northern australia and decide to spend a day of fishing in the remote swamp areas it doesn t take too long before a gigantic and ferocious crocodile capsizes their little boat and devours the guide grace lee and adam barely manage to escape the reptile s hungry teeth by climbing up a tree even though he remains unseen most of the time the croc patiently lies in waiting and makes it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive yes it does sound an awful lot like the plot of open water indeed replace the numerous unseen sharks with one giant unseen crocodile and the open sea with an equally inescapable aussie swamp and there you have it oh well black water at least features some rare moments of excitement and one impressively designed water monster it has to be said the croc looks fabulously groovy and you anxiously count down towards every next time he wildly emerges from the water the three headed cast does whatever they can to keep their characters interesting but how do you achieve this by sitting in a tree the whole time the based on true events concept obviously causes a number of restrictions like limited images of the fantastic filming locations dialogs and amiable character drawings 
106,the plot is about a female nurse named anna is caught in the middle of a world wide chaos as flesh eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer so far so good i usually enjoy horror movies but this piece of film doesn t deserve to be called horror it s not even thrilling just ridiculous even the flintstones or kukla fran and ollie will give you more excitement it s like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor the heroes who has locked themselves in inside the shopping mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside are not better either even though they doesn t seem to be drunk they give the impression of being mentally disabled save your money instead of spending it on this 
849,i ve seen some very terrible horror movies in my time and while this isn t the worst of the bunch it s certainly in the lower half the script starts off ok a young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife cute huh the movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients turns out that there s a demon on the basement that s harvesting people s souls it s the job of the 1 doctor 1 nurse and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects at this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid i was begging for it to be over there was still an hour to go it looked like a half an hour tales from the crypt episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap fest from tiny lister doing his best john coffey the green mile impersonation to tracy scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid nurse ratchet this movie fails in every possible level i gave this 2 stars for only two reason 1 his fianc√© is pretty hot she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2 the movie actually looks ok a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal mart quality home cameras in the end avoid this turd even if you have the blockbuster movie pass which i do and i still felt cheated as a bonus drinking game you and your buddies take a shot every time matt stasi dr james bishop shakes his head while talking you ll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie 
490,i have seen the film a few days back on a video tape and even though it was hard to swallow it at one take because of its length and story i liked it very much i was impressed first by the script and then by the realization of this script the film takes you on a ride but that is not an easy joyful ride it goes through time and different political regimes and shows the influence of them to ordinary people s lives what i loved was the inner logic the film followed logic which just like logic in life was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end when i thought about it all the events and twists made sense it makes no sense though to try to re tell the story as it spreads in more than 50 years of time i also liked very much nikita mikhalkov s character aleksei and the way he played it as some critics would saw with restless abandon what i didn t like about it was that i think he later played characters that remind me of aleksei in films like cruel romance zhestokij romans which i actually love and to some extent in the insulted and the injured unizhennye i oskorblyonnye sibiriada shows i think what a great film maker andrei konchalovski was before he went to hollywood and made forgettable films like tango and cash and less forgettable like runaway train i would prefer kurochka ryaba to them 
754,i don t usually like to see movies while they re still in theaters because of high ticket prices but i saw a poster for some things that stay and i thought that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious not like the usual blonde teenybopper bs so i decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it s opening night i must tell you i was happily surprised i went to this film with no expectations i didn t really know what it would be about but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by katie boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision alberta watson also did a fantastic job as the role of tamara s disease stricken mother and i must also add that i was quite impressed with the comedic stylings of megan park as tamara s friend brenda the film was wonderfully directed by gail harvey and pulled together in the kind of kitschy 50 s way that leaves you feeling warm and happy even if the storyline tended not to be so uplifting i also thought that the film was well shot many beautiful images of a 1950 s countryside will remain in my mind for weeks to come this film as a whole was quirky and great i found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open ended way i was still left satisfied whether you are looking for a fun yet powerful coming of age story or simply want to reminisce about life in the 1950 s i guarantee this film is for you even if you have no expectations it is still quite likely that you will be most impressed give this one a shot 
238,strangeland seems to have a love hate relationship with many of its viewers i personally loved the movie and everything about it the acting in some places could be improved upon but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting can t in some areas the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic but really what do you expect from the late 90s over all dee did an amazing job in writing what i believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers i ve ever seen it plays on the fears of many age groups adult parents and children every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet and it does happen in the real world and every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will that happens too in the real world which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for many my only warning is if you know you are sensitive to things such as strong violence visible torture and gore then you do not want to see this movie if you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you then read as many reviews as you can ask people you know who have seen this movie and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you become disturbed 
433,this movie is the last straw in a list of films i have seen this week that have pushed me over the edge and forced me to join imdb and spread some warning to the public it was absolutely horrible the film was drawn out and painfully boring the sound effects and even picture quality seemed like they came from willow 1988 or maybe even conan the barbarian 1982 the battle of bannockburn was absolutely absurd this largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged in the british isles made me snicker there wasn t even a coherent formation at all just a few guys with spears and horses running right through them the scenes of douglas especially in the last battle were simply horrible as was most of the acting in the film 
473,this is how i interpreted the movie first things first there was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy taylor torturing or nailing ben s hands to the wall however the same cannot be told of the gals in the end too u see taylor disappear as he walks looks like the message there was there was no taylor and the whole movie was a figment of imagination of ben also there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as ben it was taylor all the time but in real taylor was ben if they were two different people then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times but of course before that u do see both of them together and that cud just be ben s imagination at work also when ben was out of jail the text on screen clearly says that ben s story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained read mine cars etc even after liz hunter leaves kristy and comes back to find ben she doesn t find him why because ben taylor was out looking for the gals instead kristy has all the time in the world to check out taylor s ben web cam photos etc somehow everything sums up to just one fact that kristy and liz both of them knew that taylor was ben so my conclusion is that ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and taylor in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination otherwise if there really was a taylor then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ben 
88,wtf do any of his books movies end in a happy ending the notebook was good but sheesh enough with the depressing endings already i m told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life understandable but sometimes it s nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days don t we already know what really happens in real life can t we for one moment an hour and a half live vicariously through a movie that ends on a happy note that gives us hope for our own futures yeah wah i know but for real i think we need to preface movies that end like this one with a warning beware no happy ending 
912,this movie was good i can t say it was one of the best but it still was good the only reason that i watched it was because of ryan phillippe he is soo hot don t get mad reese but i think that it was sort of funny not a laugh your head out kinda thing but still o k 
792,andie mcdowell is beautiful as the 40 ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling out with 2 long time best girldfriends seeing a gigolo gold digger in the sincere young man the girl friends dead set on terminating this silly relationship go over and beyond the call of duty in helping out their friend who obviously is blinded by this gigolo s tricky game a short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous far fetched no longer covers it without these unbelievable scenes there may have been hope for a sweet love story instead all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head these things just don t happen without giving away cliff hanger details i warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film most like me will be very disappointed on a scale of 1 to 10 this one ranks a weak 4 with me there is much better material out there this one isn t worth your time 
924,i don t remember barnaby jones being no more than a very bland standard detective show in which as per any quinn martin show act i was the murder act ii was the lead character figuring out the murder act iii was the plot twist another character murdered act iv was the resolution and the epilogue was betty lee meriwether asking her father in law barnaby jones buddy ebsen how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show one thing i do remember was the late great composer jerry goldsmith s excellent theme song strangely the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air i will also admit that it was nice to see ebsen in a role other than jed clampett despite ebsen being badly miscast i just wished the show was more entertaining than when i first remembered it update 1 11 2009 i watched an interview with composer jerry goldsmith on youtube through their archive of american television channel let s just say that i was more kind than goldsmith about the show barnaby jones 
999,there is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film let s just face it though the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for leo and cate who are not necessarily the best actors in this film i m not saying they re not good actors i m saying they stunk in this film the special effects were decent and i will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye pleasing but it even has several major flaws for instance right before the ship goes under you can see an unfinished blue screen image behind your main characters don t get me wrong i love the story of the real titanic but i find this movie an insult to that story editing was atrocious there s no reason for any film to be over 2 1 2 hours with the exception of maybe a biographical movie and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted i will say that the music was perhaps better than i could have predicted and not just the my heart will go on song either there is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard that could very well be the highlight of the film as for the mood throughout it was extremely dull i was more relieved than sad when jack died which i know cannot be what the director intended in a nut shell i find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the titanic into an over hyped chick flick 
987,frantic somewhat mean spirited infantile humor abounds in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale it is not outrageous enough to appeal to the will ferrell crowd and not interesting enough to carry the feature length the most i can praise son in law would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor the main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth and pauly shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero there are a few amusing bits involving farm animals and that s about it the story what there is is so simplistic and predictable it makes jury duty seem like gone with the wind merk
957,i really enjoyed the detail that went into the script jonathan rhys myers misspelled and jewel were outstanding in their support roles as was jeffery wright toby mcguire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted when he had to amputate his best friend s arm knowing he would die without the procedure attention to detail with good dialect coaching to catch the southern accent incredibly well why this movie was swept under the rug by the hollywood promoters i can only imagine i have strong suspicions which makes it all the more appealing to me i have given a dozen dvd copies out for presents completely overlooked movie rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours then judge 
63,dear god where do i begin this is bar none the best movie i ve ever seen the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best why the script writers for this movie aren t writing big budget films i will never understand another is the cast it is great this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong raptor island is a work of art i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever 
896,god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as i m a huge fan of james cameron and not just since titanic i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the leaden strange days but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere on top of that i don t think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular a team episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron 
243,i m just throwing in this review to show that i m not crazy i like a lot of wynorski s work deathstalker 2 chopping mall against the law are fast paced and highly enjoyable just to prove i m not blind i have to mention this along with some shannon tweed body chemistry 3 or 4 or something are the lousy ones i ve got nothing against drawn out sex sequences but julie strain s breasts are so unnatural looking you can t help but stare at them which may be the desired effect but i didn t enjoy staring at them and several members of this cast seem depressed or disinterested the erotic thriller was the worst thing to happen to low budget flicks ever and thank god that their day has more or less done 
17,i loved this show i think the first time i tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show wasn t the shop located like right on the beach or something i actually wrote back and forth with marci for several years i lost touch and wish i could reconnect now as adults anyone know where she is now i wish they would put it out on dvd i seriously doubt that since i think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place they just don t make shows like this anymore do they i wonder if it would still hold up in this day and age do you guys know anyone that could burn dvd s of the show they taped on vhs i d be willing to pay within reason 
249,when i first heard that the subject matter for checking out was a self orchestrated suicide party my first thought was how morbid tasteless and then a comedy on top of that i was skeptical but i was dead wrong i totally loved it the cast the funny one liners and especially the surprise ending suicide is a delicate issue but it was handled very well comical yes but tender where it needed to be checking out also deals with other common issues that i believe a lot of families can relate with and it does with tact and humor i highly recommend checking out a must see i look forward to its release to the public 
929,you may not believe this but when the credits to this movie rolled i looked for the director s name when i saw it i burned it into my memory and i never forgot it this movie is beyond terrible it makes ed wood s films look like orsen welles at least b movies are entertaining this was a soul deadening experience the quality was so bad i began to wonder who allowed this to happen i hear uwe boll runs fourteen miles a day this is because wherever his movies are viewed the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork the script was terrible the lighting was like that of a high school football game and the cinematography was just above the quality of roger patterson s bigfoot video the acting was executed by people too ashamed of the production to say their lines with any credibility in the end was a film alan smithee wouldn t have put his name on i learned that day to avoid any movie by this man despite the circumstances from what i hear this is not a bad thing to do 
458, but i regret having seen it since the ratings on imdb are relatively high and they must also have been relatively high on netflix i guess i put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the uk a category that has produced many films i liked immensely saving grace on the other hand falls into the category of laugh less comedies usually populated by hollywood movies produced and directed by the talentless brenda blethyn is a capable actress and i have liked her in other movies the concept a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the penury she finds herself confronting after her husband s death does not offend me notwithstanding the strenuous efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor the film falls flat on its face falling flat on its arse might have been funnier as far as i and my wife were concerned be forewarned oh gentle reader not all offbeat british comedies succeed this one is a dud 
318,terrific movie if you did not watch yet you must watch geena davis and samuel l jackson are amazing in this movie great actors good story incredible action scenes the long kiss goodnight i give it a 10 a 4 stars 
406,well now that all of the director productions company s friends and relations have posted their shill reviews after seeing this at various festivals i guess it s time to show reviews written by people who actually paid 10 bucks to see it like the director s dear jesse the only other one of his films i have seen loggerheads suffers from a lack of focus and too many ideas crammed into an indie budget i swear this guy might have better luck doing miniseries i kept waiting for the various plot threads to come together but they only intercepted at points blatantly forshadowed in a way obvious to all but the most dense viewer it was like watching a season of lifetime made for tv movies crammed into one long did i say looong sketch on the old carol burnett show maybe an enterprising male suitor could take his girlfriend to see this and then exclaim hey remember all of the chick flicks we went to last year the one about the adoptive mother the one about the gay guy the one about the christian housewife we went to three chick flicks last year so now we have to go see terminator 4 i guess one has to do anything to cast a familiar actor to get funding but what oh what is bonnie hunt doing in this flick she isn t exactly known as a dramatic actress and this attempted performance won t be sending mr oscar to her door i mean speaking of lifetime original movies wasn t valerie bertinelli or farah fawcett available ms hunt has always come off to me as cold maybe she should have played the other mom i wish i would have chosen capote to fill my weekly gay themed indie allowance oh well maybe next week i think there is a good reason why capote is playing at tons of theatres all over the nyc area and this one is playing at only one let the distributors faith in this flick assure to to run in the opposite direction if you don t trust this review 
895,imagine if you took the christ myth mixed it with a healthy dose of porn against a backdrop of bad sci fi blackxploitation brotha from another planet like throw in a dash of after school special and lots of really bad kung fu fighting oh and some decent break dancing with an awesome casio keyboard soundtrack and some how they make this even worse than you could imagine there are at least 4 rape scenes at least one great car explosion a buff black guy running around in his undies with an uzi add alcohol and this is the perfect movie i mean lots and lots and lots of alcohol
734,why can t there be better tv movies made i was at a loose end today and watched this film on a satellite channel in the uk what a terrible waste of my time it was poor sets poor acting oh my god what a terrible flood blimey that woman can even outrun a torrent of water too i really wish that people would make tv movies using better effects better or at least more believable plots far better acting killer flood is well up there with poor acting a few bits of ham couldn t act any worse 1 final thing i really agree with the comment about the dog but i believe it would of already scarpered in real life 
452,unusually cold and silly drama from director sydney pollack soapy plot revolves around adulterous couple perishing in a plane wreck leaving their spouses to find eachother and connect on their own intimate level romance novel writing gets sluggish treatment although i thought the performances by leads harrison ford and kristen scott thomas were fine slick production holds interest even though the plot keeps covering the same ground and never builds any emotional momentum as a result the climax in the airport is a big so what 
678,i just finished watching this last weekend and found it absolutely hillarious some of the scenes i just couldn t stop laughing at dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes and just says the stoopidest things but at the same time he s just being cool to impress his girlfriend who gets arrested anyway the beach scenery is very tranquil until along comes robbie coltrane not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a saturday night when you haven t got much else to do like i did you might need to hunt around for it though i was lucky as my local video store stocks it 
383,a shame that even a talented director desplechin could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly talented actress phoenix esther kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot in an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor s plight the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer in an overly long running time the redundancy of esther s struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out desplechin s instruction just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same never feeling a convincing victory over esther s pain we never feel a victory in phoenix s talent 
747,i was under assumption that this was the cat and mouse duo but it wasn t instead it was something that shouldn t have been made not even for its time they disguise themselves in the blackface fashion because they fly to africa and they even act like stepin fetchit and all the others rolled into one there are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics being a mixed woman i have the right to say this but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons try merrie melodies coal black and de sebben dwarfs or angel puss you won t find them on dvd because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream but you can find them on a site as youtube i don t recommend little kids seeing this but if you want to see how early america was racist and ignorant these are better suggestions not to mention this particular cartoon has poor animation i know it was 1932 but i have seen better for its time plane unnecessary 1 out of 10 
124,now after watching the advent children twice the storyline isn t as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion if you haven t played ffvii or disliked it for whatever reason this movie is most likely not for you being familiar to the original story is a prerequisite to understanding ac fully otherwise you will just see the greatest cg animation in your life so far without actually spoiling the storyline i must admit that after seeing ac we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of ffvii seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered some were not ac is clearly for ffvii players fans and doesn t honestly try to be anything else there is little to none realism in it outside ffvii world which serves the purpose music is mostly reconstructed ffvii themes with a heavier touch tbm team according to end credits and works well with the eye candy without exceptions i found the music enhancing the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations we all know you can t put a ffvii in 1 5 hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than i expected there are two issues at hand in ffvii ac and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences and trust me when i say there s a lot of it action that is i m changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because i had missed a few explanatory sequences i couldn t put together the first time that provided some answers as a warning it s going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics but try not to judge the adevent children because of that if you don t let the story in it s no wonder it seems sloppy i m not going to praise the graphics because i assume we all know they are awesome which might be an understatement especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before i hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole get ready for the ride of your life there are no breaks 
295,this is actually a trilogy of 3 of somerset maugham s short tales the first one is the verger which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable after 17 years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can t read nor write so what does he do opens a tobacco shop of course the second is mr know all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten until i heard the familiar introduction another 15 minute one and also very good it worked better on film than in a book for me but then perhaps that s because i was only 14 the last time afterall the 3rd one is nearly a let down almost an hour in length it simply drags it s not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really i hadn t missed a thing overall i give them 8 9 and 6 out of 10 respectively 
248,ron hall pulls a triple threat as he writes directs and stars in vampire assassins derek washington hall is your clich√©d cop on a mission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action tossing away his badge he searches for the last vampire slayer no not buffy to take back the streets and vanquish the bloodsuckers back to the grave vampire assassins is a horrible film it rips off so many other films can you say blade that it never even attempts to establish it s own identity the script is non existent the action is horrible who says a micro budget stimulates creativity there is nothing even remotely interesting here you will get nothing out of this except a headache stay away at all costs 
181,i hired the dvd yesterday and first of all it started bad it s 4 3 aspect ratio film and it just keeps getting worse the acting is so bad and the movie itself is way to predictable i was like watching the movie and said to myself this going to happen next and guess what happened right if you want to see a good action boxing movie don t watch this one you ll end disappointed on this low budget movie like i did go and see ali its way better 
378,in thailand the americans connor colin egglesfield and his girlfriend amanda meredith monroe quarrel in a muay thai fight and amanda leaves connor alone she asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger indeed the mean vampire niran don hetrakul and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles connor joins to a clan of good vampires leaded by sang stephanie chao trying to save amanda from the claws of niran i expected that vampires the turning were a good movie the locations and the cinematography are beautiful the very heavy music score is excellent stephanie chao is gorgeous and attractive but unfortunately the screenplay and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of meredith monroe does not help her fallen breasts the story is very short and the unknown marty weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle race fights and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum running time for film my vote is four title brazil vampiros a convers√£o vampires the conversion 
687,i m not a big musical fan but this is one of the few i really love unlike many other musicals such as the sound of music none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff each song is social commentary acumen on war sexuality recalcitrance spirituality and freedom especially amazing songs are easy to be hard age of aquarius hair flesh failures 3 5 0 0 walking in space and hare krishna totally revolutionary and wonderful i can t wait to someday see it live 
35,my daughter liked it but i was aghast that a character in this movie smokes as if it isn t awful enough to see product placement actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies at least children movies should be more considerate i wonder was that intentional did big tobacco sponsor the film what does it take to ban smoking from films at least films intended for children and adolescents my daughter liked it but i was aghast that a character in this movie smokes as if it isn t awful enough to see product placement actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies at least children movies should be more considerate i wonder was that intentional did big tobacco sponsor the film what does it take to ban smoking from films at least films intended for children and adolescents 
78,one of the major successes to the decline of western civilization filmmaker penelope spheeris indie breakthrough is that it can perhaps appeal to non punk fans as to the hardcore ones more importantly it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely market worthy when bands would play or at the least try to play in some cases in dank dirty clubs to an audience that had as much self respect as they had respect for the bands for the fan such as myself there are precious interviews with some of the quasi legends of la s punk scum some dead some still living and still hard working in the scene performances and interviews include the likes of the circle jerks x black flag in the pre henry rollins days catholic discipline fear the alice bag band and most memorable in my opinion being the germs while i knew of a few of the bands and performers in the film the jerks and black flag mostly i had only heard rumors about lead singer the late darby crash and from the footage in the film he seems to be one of the if not the epitomes of the punk movement he doesn t take himself too seriously he loves to drink sometimes when he speaks it s complete gibberish and the attitude he brings on stage is both funny and in a free form way exhilarating a performer like that would probably scare steve miller and jackson browne out of their skins decline of western civilization may not turn on every non punk fan that seeks this film out it s hard to find on video but it shouldn t necessarily turn them off either like a kind of anthropologist that s sneaked into the party spheeris gets the behavior of these people down pat their motives their likes and hatreds and the power that was their on and off screen personas a few of them almost come off as normal some don t but they re only offensive to those who aren t too open to things on top of that the film is a must see to the kinds of kids that think they re punk fans just because they listen to good charlotte and blink 182 if you want to get the real scoop on the movement and genre of rock you profess to love give the pioneers a chance a
141,if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodes ka den it was making it with the partnership he formed with the four knights the other three being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa didn t stop delivering what he s infamous for with his dramas the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn t be ignored but it s not at all a fault of kurosawa s the material in dodes ka den is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot there s things that happen to these people and kurosawa s challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as there s not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan a brain damaged man child who goes around all day making train sounds the clickety clack of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off there s the father and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site specific descriptions of his dream house an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on he s lost a lot more than he ll tell most people including a woman who has a past with him a shy quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father or uncle i m not sure who rapes her and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife to those who are social around there are also little markers of people around these characters like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them and there s the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course there s a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it s about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture it s a little post apocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets it s a marginalized society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people with one scene in particular when the deathly looking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it sometimes there s charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawa s cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise his camera movements still remain as they ve always been patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them i e the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it s one of his paintings lush sprawling spilling at times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter it s like the abstract has come full throttle into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath it s a brilliant tricky double edged sword that allows for the dream like intonations with such heavy duty drama with a sweet movie score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career dodes ka den is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality 
77,until i saw this film life is beautiful was my favourite film of all time this film is everything a great film should be great script unsurpassed acting and direction that neither approaches the sentimentalism the subject tempts nor leaves it without the emotional impact it demands this film contains the taste that could not come from hollywood and lacks the pretencion that would come from france a wonderful movie even above the calibre i have come to expect when i see the handmade films logo come up i need not go into detail as the previous posts encompass everything why this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet 
517,as many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that i find amusing this is not a film cue dramatic music it s just a so bad it s good totally surreal jackie chan stunt for all the women fighters are totally kick butt and jackie is definitely put in his place this is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a sunday afternoon surrounded by munchies ready to roar with laughter cheer on the good guys boo the bad guys and continually yell what when something totally bizarre happens great fun 
620,director kinji fukasaku is perhaps best known in his homeland at least for his japanese gangster films a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both shogun s samurai and battles without honor and humanity and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die and since so little is done to develop them their deaths have little impact when they do come this film has other flaws as well the makeup costumes and sound design are distractingly poor and the battle scenes were substandard as well inferior to other samurai films of earlier years seven samurai comes to mind sonny chiba plays the sonny chiba character in shogun s samurai the no nonsense master swordsman who strides through the film scowling menacingly what a guy he even gets to wear an eye patch if you were expecting to see the legendary toshiro mifune you may be disappointed his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting he disappears for good overall the strengths of the film are its story which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father who may have had some help on his way out early on it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn t be more clearly good and evil after all the older brother stammers and has a birthmark the sure sign of a villain eventually however it becomes clear that in a winner takes all struggle for power there are no heroes and villains only winners and losers 
881,there s not really that much wrong with crash of the moons basically it s a few episodes of rocky jones space ranger merged into a film it is extremely dated however winky s treatment of vena is a good example of this one has to remember that it was geared to be shown to children in the 1950 s in this respect it succeeds if you like children s sci fi from the 1950 s go ahead and take a look at it you ll see john banner in a pre sgt schultz role he does a pretty good job in it all in all i d give it a 6 out of 10 not great but not bad 
790,i first saw this one when it was first shown so i m not too objective about it it really managed to scare me partly because it was so late at night but partly because of that whole feeling from a videotaped suspense story the same thing that helped dark shadows itself and the casting was so right i hardly know shane briant from anything else so it might not be so right to call him well cast but to me he is dorian gray and as far as the other male actors the one who fit his part so well was nigel davenport who s so good at larger than life characters as sir henry and john karlen a sort of dan curtis repertory player at the time because of dark shadows as one poster points out this version manages to include the involvements with men in a fairly subtle way the scene where dorian recites a list of men s names to john karlen s character as a way of blackmailing him and the look on karlen s face were very well done if that scene were done now it would probably be done in a too obvious way and be bad by comparison i saw it when dorian gray was barely a name to me let alone more so even more than the famous 1945 version which is rightly famous this is the version to me 
759,this movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in english history the film version of cromwell s growing involvement in the war is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off this film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the civil war was in no way catholic versus protestant both sides were protestant cromwell was never present at the battle of edgehill nor did he ever save the day the royalists did not win the battle ended in a draw as another reviewer has noted cromwell was certainly not one of the five members who were to be removed from the house and arrested overall this movie was decent the producers tried way to hard and it didn t turn out so great definitely could have been better 
27,and not in a fun to watch way it s just bad it s shocking that people have posted positive things about it here the story sucks the acting is bad it s not scary the special effects aren t special oh no the blackboard has hands coming out of it oh gee the mirror turned into water the hair clothes and makeup in the 50s scenes aren t accurate and they got a middle aged man with a receding hairline to play the high school version of himself this is like later on nightmare on elm street stuff i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else but there are better bad ones out there to choose from 
297,lets start off by saying that jawani diwani is just a pathetic movie i agree with the last person who said i missed the joyride lol the jokes were just terrible performances were average something went terribly wrong with the film emraan totally deserved something better all celina jaitley did was expose hrishitta bhatt was ok emraan hashmi was ok too mann emraan hashmi is a desperate guy who wants to become famous therefore he uses radha and pretends he loves her only because her father is a music director and could help him become famous since the father obeys everything his daughter says one day mann and his friends go to goa to have some fun there he meets roma celina jaitley and totally falls for her looks and tries to flirt with her bla bla bla then that night roma cannot open the door to her room and mann decides to help her seeing that he cannot as well roma goes to ask for help while she is gone mann is able to open the door and decides to come inside and sits on her bed bla bla bla roma comes in and they have a one night stand however in that one night stand roma falls in love with him that morning they spot the underworld don mahesh who sees it all the don loves roma and couldn t stand what he saw he orders them to get married and being frightened mann obeys the order and merry s roma then their marriage news ends up in the newspaper mann is later finds out that he loves roma after they do a music video together he is now trapped between love and fame bla bla bla the movie is horrible the songs sini ne sini ne is fantastic the remix version is even better dil diwana is also great the title track is also awesome guys avoid watching this movie 
508,i couldn t even sit through the whole thing this movie was a piece of crap i had more fun watching dont tell mom the babysitter s dead it was just too painful to watch say besides austin powers has tom arnold ever been in a hit movie 
981,proof why hollywood conventions are in place stale dialogue underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn s bonnie and clyde 1967 and george roy hill s butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 truly innovative filmmakers and films but falling well below the bar problems with storylines being self explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor stills black white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can t transition well or to replace scenes that just didn t work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 overly dramatic pauses between sentences random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn t needed for storytelling plus over the top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980 s i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post production the playing of music in most two shots and close ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots doors footsteps and dialogue a style used in the late 60 s through the mid 70 s by new directors but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no likeable characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the hero a necessity for any story to work for me we know from penn s and hill s movies who the heroes are even though they are criminals we like them and want to see them get away i could care less who was on the screen in this film i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger s life from june 1933 to july 1934 his death to be fair there are some moments of good solid storytelling which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn t seem to try to copy other filmmakers dillinger 1973 isn t a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial big budget debut but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy 
187,this movie features a gorgeous brunette named danielle petty she has stunning green eyes and is in the first few scenes and the last scene she is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive she may not have a future as an actress because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers the movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it it is not a good horror film or a good fake journalistic report or remotely well done there is no skill apparent in it s production it is like a bad student film the story s horrific elements do not make you sick it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick i would give this movie zero stars if i could 
330,along with in the army this ranks as one of pauly shore s best movies if there is such a thing while the whole west coast meets midwest culture clash isn t anything new this film proves to make the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh shore while the change in values probably would have gone in the other direction the whole concept was rather entertaining not only was shore s interaction with the family hilarious it also had carla gugino and tiffani amber theissen she ll always have the amber in my book in two ravishing and early roles one of those films i have no problem watching when it is on tv 
745,i broke my own rule buying this movie from the 5 88 bin at walmart basically if a movie has a big star in it and you ve never heard of it before it s usually for a reason well in the case of this movie the reason is because it sucked they plaster sandra bullock s photo and name all over the cover of the dvd as bait and it reeled this little fishie right on in i was thinking of donating the disc to charity or giving it to the library but i don t think i would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie worst lines what do you mean army buddies what do you mean your dad 
228,first off i have to say acting isn t very good miranda cosgrove is the main character but is not such a good actress quite frankly spencer her brother is a way much better actor spencer is easily my favorite character because he probably is the only one that knows how to act carly on the other hand tries to act her heart out but sorry it just isn t good sam doesn t even get credit i mean come on icarly pretty self centered eh freddy isn t bad i don t have a comment i must add that carly and her puppet sam change their attitude whenever they go to film a web cast they go shouting out all their lines it s sorta bad influence in a way because carly has a web show and if kids will copy this they might be giving their own information and that not pretty safe the only nice things is that it has some funny parts of the show which makes it entertaining at least this show isn t boring it has nice plots pretty strong many kids will like this because they don t look for flaws overall this is a bad show but it s not boring 
769,there is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school the parental absence at all important junctures in lauren ambrose s school search provide admissions interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading the incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another thus masking her mother s truer involvement in family losses the daughter lauren really has done something big trying to make her mother fulfilled and then that plan itself somewhat heroic in light of the age she is still giving when everyone around her taking somersaults on her a heart not yet connected to her head something that age has never had a genuine answer to even to this day her replacement of a significant other not necessarily requiring a father image however a trusted authority nonetheless being imagined if not real a pure cup without a handler see the movie everyone needs a friend to see through understanding of a proportional world she made hers up on what she knew of life at the time she has all the mental capacity for higher learning though having no friends present for her time makes the ending a developmental tragedy in progress given a bird in a cage not a puppy that would a least get her walking two times a day ideas out of the roof she is under would be the developing on her sidewalk life sad is the looming psychiatric ending how could she be committed at a time when she has proved an important responsibility believe it or not taking of a dog is a better witness than taking care of a bird at this time of her life the symbolic cage of her in a cage is too much mental and self fulfilling of some of her writings within the story the neighbor college freshman is developed just fine he is as developed as the training education will allow for the mental maturity that dwarfs her eternal purpose compared to his fateful conditioning i myself eventually just went to the mensa magazine and got a 20 00 degree saying i was an hon ddiv it offered all the education that buying the truth would and independence to skip fecal content run the world or do not get your own home was the college offer who was freeing anyone for superior time for the learning the only sin is not having your pleasure right what fight figged on that she has been denied an act for life commensurate to her love for life what is college a reward for failing high school do you graduate with your class or without it what is the exchange a lifetime of correcting youth with only questions could lead occur w o a question the loss followed as much for good as bad when was she given a mind for sexual intimacy or growth for her good self to be fulfilled why didn t good people treat her with good things if good people do not do good things for good people what is good for she is young pretty and walked on long before personal development is given a winning game her act taken in life with a closed door perhaps the title would be better as christmas doors not admissions 
114,i watched the 219 minute version and have to say that dollar for dollar it it probably one of the worst films ever now i am not saying it s the worst film ever but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it this is a very very bad film i would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writer director michael cimino rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person had he not been so self indulgent a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes saving the studio millions the film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that s supposed to be set at harvard the scene is huge but completely without context you have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students in particular john hurt are behaving so boorishly i find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870 and it looks a lot more like 1970 this is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening who the characters are or their motivations the next scene is 20 years later inexplicably the two harvard grads hurt and kris kristofferson are in wyoming so they went to the best school in america and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is well what is john hurt in the film he just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk the prologue or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers even though he is apparently against them his entire character made no sense they never explained why he was a brit living in the middle of nowhere it was impossible to hide his accent why he bothered to come along with the hired army if he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didn t believe in at all as for kristofferson his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable though having him move to wyoming and risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at all this brings up the worst aspect of heaven s gate while the scenes are way too long and needed trimming the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard john hurt a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film jeff bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why in fact other than kristofferson isabelle huppert as a hooker with a heart of gold quite the clich√© and perhaps christopher walken everyone is completely one dimensional it s hard to imagine a movie this long where you don t know or understand the characters much of the film also seems anachronistic who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890 i am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the west would have been very very difficult and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of food maybe if they hadn t spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink the farmers could have afforded to buy food and avoided this war over purloined cattle and what s with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle what did this have to do with a land war the most obvious problem you are left with is that it s a film where very very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film there are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness so much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it s inevitable that nothing could salvage the film as for the final battle it was done reasonably well but had problems first this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the d day invasion second while details of the actual events of the so called johnson county war are a tad sketchy we do know that the characters played by huppert and kristofferson never actually were there as they d both been hung before the battle third i can t believe that cimino actually killed animals throughout the film especially during the final battle while i am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve cimino s vision for the film is very sad finally after the big battle we have an epilogue while it is blessedly short it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague we see kristofferson on a fancy yacht so we can assume that he s finally putting some of that harvard education to work for himself we also see a woman who appears to be one that kris looked at a couple times during the prologue most importantly nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome i read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong overall to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying wwii was a minor tiff well i ve certainly seen a lot worse but if you factor in the cost of production i truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history finally when a film has this much explicit nudity i warn parents however as no child could sit through this film even with a promise of sex the warning is not necessary 
398,spacecamp is my favorite movie it is a great story and also inspires others the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie the 20th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school i also know a close friend of the late pilot i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers invisible going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result so i m much closer to the accident and any movie similarities i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later strangely enough on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in 1986 and who later built endeavour 
109,i have to admit i have a particular penchant for the humor and story telling style of british movies though not all of course succeed this film made me think and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face its about character development and relationships truth and lies and whether love is sometimes simply not enough some very nicely understated acting from all the participants especially the two leads tom wilkinson and emily watson there was a lot of fuss made about gosford park but with this piece i feel fellowes has actually produced a better movie though it has not been a mainstream release an intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed but also capable of acts of genuine graciousness 
550,standard rise to fame tale that has a few high points number one lonette mckee as sister who gives a stunning star making performance the fact that she never became a huge sensation after this is beyond me sadly she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on irena carter s bland character sparkle whose rise to fame is easy boring and unconvincing however whenever the girls go on stage and perform the movie comes back to life the original music by curis mayfield must be praised the copy i saw was a very old vhs tape the picture quality was pretty low as well as the production values i m guessing all in all its worth a gander 
504,the howling ii starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by christopher lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason he says for it s written the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with her blood and i saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication s and upon her forehead was written behold i am the great mother of an inaudible word i couldn t make out no matter how many times i rewound the tape and tried to sorry and all abominations of the earth this opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre after the opening credits which are set over shots of transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we re in los angeles california u s a city of the angels i knew i was in for a long 86 minutes it s probably not too long after the events of the original howling 1981 and it s karen white s funeral after the ceremony karen s brother ben reb brown is spoken to by an occult investigator called stefan crosscoe christopher lee who says that karen is a werewolf and that she will come back to life ben dismisses such nonsense but together with one of karen s friends and colleagues jenny annie mcenroe he visits stefan at his home there stefan tells them about werewolves and how they can be killed he mentions stirba sybil danning who is the queen of werewolves stefan also shows them a photograph taken at karen s funeral of a woman named mariana marsha a hunt and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous werewolf who wants karen stefan says he will stake any werewoves through the heart with titanium ben figures out that stefan means he will stake karen as well so together with jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister s crypt is to stop stefan however lots of werewolves turn up and attack stefan ben and jenny they survive the attack and manage to find out that stirba is to be found in transylvania they all decide to travel to transylvania and stop stirba and her werewolves from taking over the earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse once there they travel to a small town called vlkava which means where wolves live and meet up with the local priest father florin ladislav krecmer and his small but loyal group of werewolf hunters hey what else can i call them oh and a dwarf named florica ludmila safarova helps too they follow mariana who they hope will lead them to stirba but stirba knows of stefan s arrival and has plans for him ben and jenny will stefan be able to put an end to stirba s plans for world domination will this film get any more bizarre or surreal watch it and find out directed by philippe mora this is one strange mess of a film it s poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently the single biggest problem is the script by robert sano and gary brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn t make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring unlike the original something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained most people will probably hate it but for those of us who enjoy bad films this is right up there with the best of them there are werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch we get some cool werewolf killing weaponry the sets and locations just seem so out of place and i don t know if this was actually shot in transylvania but it doesn t look like what i thought mid 80 s transylvania would stirba s castle is part dungeon part gothic castle and part modern luxury house stirba and her servant s costumes are very over the top stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a s m video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too the special make up effects range from good to poor a dwarf s eyes explode someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn t a film loaded with gore although there are plenty of effect sequences with werewolf transformations and attacks there is plenty of nudity as well as stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of werewolves i should also mention the music the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that i hated and i ended up turning the volume down acting is weak all round and what on earth was christopher lee thinking about when he accepted this film i wonder what he thinks of it basically the whole thing is a real mess but i found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage it also features the same shot of sybil danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times if that s your thing 
218,the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi s fate as an assassin fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga that s as poetical as i ll get when talking about azumi 2 death or love because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood driven assassin after watching azumi 2 i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience in azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics which is their number one priority as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape but i won t hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi s way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma by the way chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go minus the cool weapon and sense of menace this brings me to the final blow which is the action simply disguised in the title as the death side of the epic in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons to no one s surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily in azumi 1 the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation i won t lie and i ll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film but i ll step right up and say that after watching azumi 2 the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece for what it s worth azumi 2 death or love could have gone straight to video with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins doing their best to restore the peace with an unwavering courage to die trying 
869,i had not seen the movie trailer when i went to see the movie instead i based my judgments on a friend s opinions now i like chris rock and his comedy but this movie just falls flat on its face during the movie rock delivers a couple of funny jokes but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy the movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one and it that endeavor it fails the love story in the movie is straight forward luckily but it detracts too much from the movie by making rock serious and bland after all the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy where laughter should be the primary concern not much of that in the movie the plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole some parts were discontinuous altogether if the supporting cast were meant to be funny they certainly didn t do a good job the couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes which were dry and dull rock s first incarnation s couple of underlings were also bland if there s one thing they did do right though they made rock seem funnier by comparison 
505,i loved this movie when i was a kid i saw it theatrically randy edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack david seville is the chipmunks father and recording manager the chipmunks consist of alvin who is best known for playing the harmonica simon who is a bright and studious chipmunk theodore who is the youngest and is always hungry there is a lady known as miss miller who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as brittany jeanette eleanor who all have the same character as the chipmunks my favourite songs from this soundtrack include diamond dolls the girls of rock roll the touching my mother alvin really wanted to see europe when dave had to go there for business the chipmunks meet the chipettes playing the around the world in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing 
541,i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character spolier alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller s performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards 
750,i m not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good i was stunned easily the most romantic thing i ve ever seen in my life stunning brilliant sweet funny and full of heart the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they re a couple the movies grabs you right away and doesn t let go you can t look away nor can you stop listening to them even the little moments just melt your heart this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever a masterpiece 
921,great actors good filming a potentially interesting plot and what should have been good dialog nothing else is good about this movie perhaps the writer or director thought they could make a thought provoking film out of annoying characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee within 10 minutes i disliked the portrayal of kim by caroleen feeney so much that it became a distraction while kim is supposed to be an unsympathetic character i am not sure i was supposed to want to commit acts of physical violence upon her the first of many bizarre things that happen is that wes david strathairn goes from i am missing 50 00 to she stole 50 in about 3 seconds it was quite implausible since she kim never had access to his wallet nor was she a master pickpocket there simply was no rational reason to suspect her most people have lost misplaced money and assume just that we lost it same goes for kim later all very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be i think a look at real people the character of kim was at minimum suffering from a bipolar disorder wes had huge inadequacy issues nancy was just boring and matt was delusional particularly about music i actually turned this off about 2 3 of the way through however to write a valid comment i forced myself to turn it back on hoping that something would come together in this movie no sorry it was still bad make it a point to miss this one 
352,well well roeg touched a bit of a nerve there didn t he he was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters descents into psychosis for a couple of decades but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption or even some good advice might be found in the bad old catholic church the hipper than thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious worse still theresa russell s character faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level that of the spiritual you know the realm of the ignorant and superstitious the sort of thing that the art house cinephiles are supposed to be above oh the horror so she finds her marriage the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention people who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives but they probably won t sure this film has some problems notably talia shire s delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun 1950s style attire and all and the dialogue between marie davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the spellbound school of glib interpretations though hitchcock s movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a freudian psychoanalyst but sadly nicolas roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents 
97,this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today s more hectic and loud films it is another solid based on a true store which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes frankly i don t know but i liked the story the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else including his father does in this west virginia town the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father which i think was overdone i would like to have a little less tension between the two the young man still a boy is played by jake gyllenhaal one of his first staring assignments i think he s likable as are his school buddies in here it s nice to see nice kids in a modern day film the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper the dad and laura dern the kid s teacher who encourages him all the time the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear once again i wish there more of these kind of films made today 
425,did anyone read the script this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year three great actors paul giamatti rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldn t pull this one out about two thirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying i can t believe i signed the contract it s not the worst movie i ever saw but it s on the really really bad christmas movie list not enough lines but what else can be said okay the movie just doesn t move with vaughn s con man dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just can t get past it was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into 
454,i enjoyed this film it was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of peter o donnell a number of people have disliked the film but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is the film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became before the network before willie garvin the pace is a trifle slow and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes however this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version if you like modesty blaise you will enjoy it even with its faults if you just want an action flick with car chases forget it it has the feeling of being the first of a franchise but as i have never seen it promoted anywhere i suspect there will be no more to follow sadly 
700,when i first watched this film i thought that it would be rally good because it featured my favourite actor of all time he gives a sterling performance though it is fairly obvious he didn t have to life more than half a finger to make the r√≥le work he is the only good thing in it unlesss you re into explosions and american dream working class hero trash which i m not i don t get it how can this film get away with being so naf that bit with the little boy being rescued i mean come on you can t tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire guy wearing any goggles i know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you can t see for more than a couple of feet infront of you and no breathing equipment he d have choked after 2 minutes this film was just bad ok why robert whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy sorry if this is your favourite film 
102,why is it that virtual x rated video game women can speak through their mouths but virtual fighting game champion dante has to use a combination of telepathy and over dramatic facial expressions i feel that either they needed to cast someone who looked more villain like michael bermardo s big brown doe eyes don t exactly strike fear in the hearts of well anyone except for maybe casting directors who consistently cast him as either a villain or a heroic bad boy or they needed to just let him use his real voice and move his mouth and maybe give him a costume that would not make him stick out like a sore thumb when walking down the street but of course this is the future and we must assume that bad fashion taste is considered the norm 
15,while movie titles contains the word mother the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother s love for her children however the mother tells a different story the mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child here notting hill director roger michell tells us how a mother s love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her before daniel craig takes on the role of james bond here he plays darren a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother and sleeping with her daughter as well anne reid who was a familiar face on tv series takes up the challenging role of the leading character may the story begins with may coping with the sudden loss of her husband toots in a family visit to her son bobby while she befriends darren a handyman who is doing some renovation in bobby s house she was shocked to found out that her daughter paula was sleeping with darren at the same time may was coping with life after the death of toots fearing that harry and paula do not wanted her may starts to find her life going off track until she spends her afternoon with darren darren was nice and friendly to may and may soon finds some affection on darren instead of treating him like a friend she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple later may found sexual pleasure from darren where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else and this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family the mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on this can be told from may buying tea time snacks for darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for anne reid has made a breakthrough for her role of may as she was previously best well known for her various role on tv series as she do not have much movies in her career resume the mother has put her on the critic s attention daniel craig on the other hand had took on a similar role in his movie career such as sylvia 2003 and enduring love 2004 if his reprising role of james bond fails film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career and the mother is one of them the mother may not be everyone s favorite but it is definitely not your usual matin√©e show to go along with tea and scones accompanied by butter and jam 
784,well i got and saw this movie based on the rather high score here 7 1 now and some of the good reviews usually imdb is a good guide when it comes to score though in this case i was very much deceived the movie is a present day detective story with vinnie jones as the investigator journalist who investigates the death of a construction worker mixed with this is a made up dickens novel called the riddle set in the 18th or 19th century which also deals with a murder story both story lines are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript sounds interesting it could have been however this movie horribly fails in a number of areas 1 acting mediocre at best but it is watchable no worse than your average uk sitcom though for a movie one expects a little better especially with a score of over 7 2 music the music used is simply horrible it distracts and it is annoying especially the pub music and the music which plays in the journalist s apartment 3 storyline this is a big joke there are gaping plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it s almost funny furthermore without going into any detail i can safely say that the ending is absurd and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year 4 camera work at times camera positions and views are distracting and serve absolutely no purpose to the story i m a bit of a movie fanatic and watch on average 1 to 2 movies a day but this is easily the worst movie i ve seen in months don t waste your money or your time on this rubbish 
426,the british production company amicus is generally known as the specialist for horror anthologies and this great omnibus called the house that dripped blood is doubtlessly the finest amicus production i ve seen so far admittedly there are quite a few that i have yet to see though the house that dripped blood consists of four delightfully macabre tales all set in the same eerie mansion these four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully gothic atmosphere and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable peter cushing christopher lee cushing and lee are two of my favorite actors ever as well as denholm elliott and the ravishing ingrid pitt star in this film so which true horror fan could possibly afford to miss it no one of course and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast the house that dripped blood revolves around an eerie rural mansion in which strange things are happening in four parts the film tells the tales of four different heirs the first tale method for murder tells the story of horror novelist charles hyller denholm elliott who moves into the house with his wife after moving in the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation the first segment is a great kickoff to the film the story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very good in the second story waxworks retired businessman phillip grayson peter cushing moves into the house and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious wax museum in the nearby town the great peter cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this and the rest of the performances are also very good the tale is delightfully weird and the second best of the film after the third the third tale sweets to the sweet is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four john reed christopher lee moves in with his little daughter the private teacher and nanny mrs norton whom mr reed has employed to instruct his daughter is appalled about her employer s strictness towards his daughter and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective father s views on upbringing may have this best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot christopher lee is as always superb in his role nyree dawn porter is also very good as the nanny and my special praise goes to then 11 year old chloe franks this ingenious segment alone makes the film a must see for every true horror fan in the fourth segment horror actor paul henderson jon pertwee moves into the house with his sexy mistress co star carla ingrid pitt this fourth story is satire more than it is actually horror it is a highly amusing satire however and there are many allusions to other horror films at one point henderson indirectly refers to christopher lee who stars in the previous third segment all four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere as stated above the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous horror tales that every horror lover should appreciate an igenious atmosphere a macabre sense of humor genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a must see in short the house that dripped blood is an excellent horror omnibus that no lover of british horror could possibly afford to miss highly recommended 
927,i saw this very emotionally painful portrayal and it was fascinating the conflict between the public and private faces of williams and the pressure he was under is illuminated in a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised the cast acted superbly but michael sheen was outstanding i only realised it was him when i saw the earlier comment he looks completely physically different in this role from any other role i have seen him in or as himself williams autobiography differs markedly from his diaries as represented in this film the film is at times distressing to watch because of the emotional anguish displayed however it is a worthwhile experience and a film that can be recommended highly 
133,from the brilliant mind that brought us the exorcist and cruising rampage is unfortunately more like the latter it s an overall messy movie that has a major made for tv vibe going for it the whole film pretends to hinge on the question what if the boy next door was a serial killer but instead it winds up being an uninspired courtroom drama and meditation on the the insanity plea and death penalty that makes little sense the movie is very loosely based on the richard trenton chase case culling a few facts here and there to make a fake character and a different outcome one of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a terminally braindead child and ending the life of a murderer are somehow analagous sometimes you just have to choose says the lead character yeah sometimes you have to choose to pull the plug on your tv 
340,this film is about a group of extra terrestrial gay black men exterminating females on earth in order to create a gay universe i watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was still i was shocked at how bad it was it looked more like a film made 50 years ago the acting if any is ultra bad the sets and props are so ridiculously fake making any college film look mega budget and the special effects are laughably simple indeed jaw dropping as others have commented but jaw droppingly embarrassing one has to be severely intoxicated or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film if i was from denmark i would be severely embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen produced such a horrifyingly bad film 
11,this movie i watched back in 1981 when it came out although i missed the first part of the movie what i did see was great this movie is hard to find but if found you must see the acting is great very believable sad movie if i ever find me a copy i definitely will buy me a copy to treasure 
761,i still liked it though warren beatty is only fair as the comic book hero what saves this movie is the set the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script i really expected something more substantial in the terms of action or plot but i got very little the main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in hollywood at the time in such an unusual film the one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was madonna she did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad the movie at some points just stood still you expected something more and you got nothing al pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good he and beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy it is also interesting to see dustin hoffman and warren beatty in a film other than isthar i did not see ishtar but i heard bad things the thing about this movie is it is good but it could have been so much better i liked it as a child because i thought it looked cool and visually the movie is amazing the sets are incredible the writing is only fair and with such a cast in the movie i would expect a little better anyway spoileri especially thought the finale was not big enough it was interesting but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere the movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway the costumes and makeup were flawless as well the facial makeup for the villains was great beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character still this is a good movie that could have been much much more it is to me better than batman the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross 
360,i just checked out northanger abbey from the local library and wasn t expecting much imagine my suprise at this gothic treat northanger abbey is one of the most eerie places that you have ever seen with empty passageways and ornate rooms full of hidden secrets the glory of the movie is that it never reveals all your imagination runs free running with the imagination of the main character one kathrine m she is a girl of wild imaginations a reader of gothic fantasy that she brings into her and our real world if i were to use one word to describe this excellent movie it would be surrealistic dreams are woven throughout the movie enhancing the mood sometimes it is hard to tell what is real and what is not this is intentional i believe atmosphere reigns supreme the music is not what you d expect of a movie by jane austen it is eerie flute and drum based high and haunting with an undercurrent of fear if a soft pleasant tune were playing in northanger abbey it would be positively inviting now it is foreboding a grim and stark walled palace of madmen but the characters you shall have to see them for yourself if you are looking for a most enjoyable evening look no further than northanger abbey 
588,sloppily directed witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the classic 50s alien invasion films but really is no better than them except of course in the purely technical department good makeup effects and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail casino royale our man flint are worse than almost any james bond movie after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens you ll be begging for some peace and quiet 1 2 
200,i cannot believe i wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was i wrong the plot was abysmal the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess however i cannot lie some of the lines in this film were quite memorable such as when the asian boy says i lost my virginity to the babysitter so f stereotypes please do not waste your time with this crash unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh maybe that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mates
170,this is an emperor s new clothes situation someone needs to say that s not a funny and original etc etc film that is an inferior film don t waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash they are all too realistically only themselves they have no lines they don t act the american dream is not to create shoddy no quality films or anything else shoddy and of no quality it is to achieve something of quality and thereby success only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood it can t have been made in hollywood can it would try to impute any kind of quality to this film it s worse than ed woods another film about a film maker without standards these films shouldn t have been made and you shouldn t go see american movie 
336,this is a movie that i watched when i was a young girl and never forgot it is certainly not the best movie ever made but there is something very special about it that i can t quite put my finger on i love it i am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me though and for that reason alone this movie drives me crazy exactly what who is that mysterious witch lady and what is her relationship with tom why and how did he become a water baby why was he raised on the earth it is questions like these that are just eating at me i thought if i read the book i would get answers but i just read an article that the book from which this story is based is a lot different so i guess i ll never know what the writer was thinking i still love this movie though and i recently watched it with my two year old niece she loves it too although she insists on calling it baby water for reasons unknown to me she loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares i m all clean you have to understand that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world we watched that scene over and over i am so glad that we can enjoy this film together there should be more films like this but what is up with the gay seahorse 
737,chris penn is hilarious as the all time stoner brother of jeff spicoli this movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge this movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong fast times was more depressing than funny abortions friends cheating on friends jerking off in bathrooms bad jobs and failing school someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life the film even had great cameos like the maker of city limits michelle schocked in the liquor store or ben stein in his first role in the sunny s surplus store 
898,the minute you give an art film 1 10 you have people baying for your ignorant half ass ed artistically retarded blood i won t try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the art house cinema i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown cult classic a 10 10 all i ask is that someone explain to me the point purpose and message of this film here is how i would summarize the film opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co incidence this followed by in a nutshell to save you 3 hours of pain the following a children s game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke addicted daughter who he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues while the game show s star contestant decides that he doesn t want to be a failed child prodigy a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for corrective oral surgery while the game show s producer himself dying of lung cancer asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru even as mr producer s second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man and oh eventually it rains frogs you read correctly and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than possibly to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a modern epic you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie and in turn of not confusing you if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently maybe in a few sentences instead of just one well now you know how i feel 
544,this show paranormal state has an almost blairwitch project feel to it as in you re watching a documentary that s actually just a scripted movie made to look and feel like a documentary my biggest problem with the show is their go to outside advisers of the warren s who were made famous for their investigations of the amityville murders which were shown to be completely fraudulent just based upon the police reports of the family s deaths such as the eldest daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths then there s the way they constantly jump to blaming demons for everything not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take they don t want to help those who need it most they just want the weirdest cases that will get them the most press and attention they re complete frauds plain and simple 
427,indeed cynthia watros is in this movie as elizabeth talking to desmond though i m just wondering how she ended up as a rehab patient where hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight as seen from the previous episodes anyway this last episode is really suspended the ending is not so understandable i think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming i just hope the next season will give light to more unclear hanging events that were happened just can t wait further for season 3 
416,it s a short movie for such immense feelings the last 20 or so minutes are among the most intense in the recent years of the industry huston john is dying and only love can make the difference the actor s work in the long evening scene is absolutely marvellous 
612,my take the silliest of the airport movies and probably one of the worst of the 70 s disaster movies as if to milk the franchise with all its got the producers of this third sequel to airport throws in more action silly subplots gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements in its attempt to be the biggest airport yet concorde airport 79 is the worst one yet and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970 s with its bad box office results it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcome the film opens with a rather catchy score by lalo schifrin backed up by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in july 2000 but then the credits appear and we get a glimpse of the all star cast which is composed nothing more of faded hollywood stars tv actors and none too popular b actors the plot is sillier than ever george kennedy is back in the role of joe patroni now the pilot of the concorde co piloted by co pilot alain delon en route to france after the summer olympics on board is reporter maggie whelan susan blakely who has just discovered that his boyfriend renowned weapons manufacturer kevin harrison robert wagner is selling their weapons to terrorist to prevent her from revealing the news to the world harrison sends his most advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the concorde from landing the cast subplots are dumber than ever even sillier than an alcoholic myrna loy or a singing nun we have cicely tyson transporting a live human heart in a cooler martha raye as a woman with a bladder condition and the character doesn t go deeper than that j j walker a a pot smoking saxophonist arguably the most annoying character in the film eddie albert married to old wife sybil danning avery schreiber as russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally a love story between reporter jon davidson and gymnast andrea marcovici much to the sour watching eye of coach mercedes mccambidge plus the movie gets much closer to love boat episode than ever with the silliest cameos of charo and her pet chihuahua and bibi anderson camp buffs will no doubt get a real kick in the balls in this silly entry in a long strain of 70 s disaster movies this one is in more than the sense of the word a true disaster rating 1 2 out of 5 
592,so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills natica jackson or power passion murder as it is called in holland when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality unfortunately it didn t 1 the plot of the film is really confusing there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film only they have nothing in common throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me but it still hasn t 2 the title of the film says the film will be about natica jackson well it is sometimes like said the film covers two different stories and the part about natica jackson is the shortest so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice to conclude my story i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it by doing this you won t waste 90 minutes of your life as i did 
282,this film has great acting great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are how you define yourself how you fit in whether you accept to play a role or break free there already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects i want to comment on the formal setting of the film basically it s two people on a roof there is unity of place and time with 2 protagonists and the radio acting as the choir many directors have turned greek tragedies into film many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a greek tragedy but no director in my opinion has succeeded as admirably as ettore scola in approaching the purity and force of the great greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting a masterpiece 
58,this masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master joseph w sarno it features plenty of soft core sex really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women the acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well made marie forsa is one of the hottest chicks i have ever seen in a horror movie it s a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body sarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies a must see for fans of sexploitation 
322,i ve often heard people express disappointment that mazursky s tempest has little to do with shakespeare s original in my opinion that is both true and false but most of all it s a bad starting point for offering critique a work of art should never be criticised for what it isn t but for what it is the movie tempest is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to shakespeare s work in spirit what tempest is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time no not experimental as in hand held camera and mumbled dialogue but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings mazursky s tempest is epic sad realistic joyous full of life but most of all it is imaginative cassavetes portrayal of philip prospero is in itself worth a 10 10 rating and when you add gena rowlands susan sarandon a wonderfully deep molly ringwald raul julia the dialogue the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture i rest my case one of the best movies of the 80 s don t miss it 
845,this film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition all this against a backdrop of an india which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values this film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front it is easy to see why fire has caused riots in india but tragic nonetheless a true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world not just privileged westerners 
665,i have seen this movie and the other one trinity is my name and i find that this one is worse then the first one i have no idea why they even made another movie it was stupid and pointless sorry to say that i have all of them i have sat through them number of times and it still drives me to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie i like terence hill movies and i like bud spencer but this movie just drove me up the wall if it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy it might have been funner and worth the 5 dollars i spent buying all the movies but you make mistakes so i would say save your money and don t bye this movie or any of the ones that go with it trust me on this one 
615,if you have read the book do not set your hopes high if you have not go read it and never watch the film it is strange to learn that toby young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script as he claims himself in the post script of the book because the film is very different from the book what the film seems to be aiming at taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it it achieves with perfection the film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had you are better off not seeing it 
546,through the years i ve been very much interested in the life of this teenager who left such a profound indelible mark on the world my fascination has also been born of fear as in could this happen again and throughout the ensuing years yes i fear it continues to happen around us and of course it was happening long before anne the it of course is can a so called civilized society turn on its own or on an innocent country race continent and murder citizens in cold blood on the flimsiest of excuses i leave that question out there at the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader adolf hitler in that the one profound fact about hitler that is never mentioned was that he was elected democratically and all of the atrocities committed were done as the result of a compliant poodle press and fear mongering propaganda played over and over again for a docile population one of the atrocities was anne frank who put a face to the death camps by the miracle of her diary s survival kenneth brannagh does a wonderful job on the commentary and interviewing he has that rare gift of minimizing his own persona thus allowing the subjects to speak for themselves many new facts and people never before interviewed are brought to life in the meticulous research which i will not go into here as they add immeasurably to the reality and gut wrenching sorrow of the film glenn close reads selections from the diary and her voice is perfect for the part she brings a naivet√© and freshness to the role old childhood friends of anne s are interviewed at length and her last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with her vibrant and mischievous personality this is not to be missed a wonderful and respectful film about the seldom seen anne 10 out of 10 
484,i was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and the fairly good rating this was a big disappointment this doesn t hold a candle to contemporary zombie flicks like shaun of the dead day of the dead land of the dead etc horror flicks sometimes take a while to get going you have to build up the characters so when they snuff it you feel some empathy etc but even so there s a full 45 minutes to sit through here even before you sniff a corpse up to that point its like watching a bad soap opera nothing of any interest or relevance happens and if you are going to watch this for the first time you can honestly start watching after 45 minutes you won t miss anything plot wise when things do get going its all very sub par stuff some of the kills and make up are done well others are done very poorly consistency is lacking here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most wooden acting i ve ever seen this could all be passable if you really believed this was all taking place on a plane but with guns being fired firebombs being let off no pilots in the cockpit in a violent storm yet the plane stays in the air c mon we re not all simpletons oh and does it really take a whole minute for a fighter jet s missile to hit a plane that is a few hundred yards away i know its a zombie film and you have to stretch things but this film along with the other main defects listed above had zero credibility one to miss 
411,the famous french detective henri cassin takes his first vacation in 11 years in st margot where he meets nanette the daughter of the vacation spot proprietors despite nanette being promised to childhood sweetheart leon henri and nanette fall in love and decide to marry despite nanette s father objecting due to henri s age on the day of their wedding leon returns and nanette runs after him nothing is heard of the two until both are found dead and henri swears he won t rest until he can find the killer the only clue henri has to work with is a footprint found by leon but he is also getting written warnings that others will die soon soon nanette s mother is found dead and henri has no idea as to the identity of the killer thinking himself a failure he returns to paris then he realizes and fears that the killer can be only one person even though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation out of the ordinary murder mystery that doesn t really follow the formula in other of the genre by columbia or other b studios credit to that certainly goes to director lewis who does manage to turn this into a noirish film despite the setting of the film also aided by the use of good camera work and lighting geray turns in a very good performance in probably his only lead and the rest of the cast is able to carry their performance rating 8 
908,if the following sounds tempting then by all means rush down to your local blockbuster and rent this movie post haste 1 awful 60 s hairstyles from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails 2 the worst child actor in the world ever who does nothing but cry and say daddy in the most annoying voice imaginable 3 lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn t mesh with the film at all 4 stereotypical indians who use blowpipes and talk gobbledegook oh and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire 5 hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set 6 the exterior shots of 5 which look suspiciously like a toy jet on a string being led around a studio lit with blue light 7 terrible special effects which make the ones used in the first star trek series look cutting edge by comparison special mention the little boy s blond hair glowing oh dear 8 laughable editing and continuity where background items move between scenes the soundtrack changes completely without any warning etc 9 not got enough money to hire a professional dancer get any lady from off the street to prance about like an idiot no one will notice the difference er 10 a thrilling climax involving quicksand snakes more stuff from the archives and a ton of fake blood don t forget to put in a stupid tribal sounding song either the more sensible among you however will wait for it s inevitable appearance on mst3k when this classic tv show is resurrected and then you can watch it in the spirit it was intended any other kind of enjoyment to be derived from this crap is unthinkable not to mention unworkable so don t even try it 0 10
87,as a fan of wm faulkner since college i was especially pleased to see intruder in the dust and for other reasons my grandfather also named clarence brown as was the director grew up in the oxford area having been born near there in 1888 we attended a week long family reunion at oxford in july 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie it still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of ole miss my recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but i was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white i was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go anyhow the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and i would love to know more about that story now days oxford is a larger more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and i hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years juano hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an oscar that year but hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen other faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare one of the best was a pbs treatment of the barn burner from about 1985 or so starring tommy lee jones it really captured the intensity of rural southern whites that faulkner wrote so incisively about so often 
853,having first read the novel i don t mind for the purposes of filming how differently it is scripted as long as it adheres to or at least includes the plot for reasons known only to hollywood important parts of the story are completely ignored and a different story line added the reason this novel passed the test of time is no doubt due to the interweaving of both the characters and plot as a whole to interfere with this structure is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line and therefore the intension of the story teller although a matter of opinion the casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired characters described as very fat should at least be made to look portly to allow for the character to have credibility the days of slavery can t be over or surely actors of this calibre would have been in revolt at such a travesty of the story the face of marian halcolme is described as being manly in appearance tara fitzgerald s very feminine appearance doesn t ring true again laura fairly is described as being fair if not ethereal so with dark hair she does not quite fit the impression gleaned from the novel badly done hollywood j hunter
10,at the surface cooley high is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading as a period piece set in the early 60 s complete with a flawless motown soundtrack but there s so much more to this film it gets better every time i see it the cast of unknowns at the time is excellent and it is notable as an all black cast film that doesn t fall into any blaxpoitation clich√©s at times cooley high almost feels like an updated urban neo realist film with lots of edgy humor added in at times the rather tight budget does show but the constraints actually serve the film well there s a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similar minded films like schultz later car wash which was more popular but largely pointless warm hearted but also true to life this might be one of the sleepers of the 70s celebrated at the time it seems that few film freaks know about this one today their loss this is a fine fine film the bare bones pan and scan dvd no widescreen is testament to just how little cared for this excellent film is 
222,this has to rate as one of the cheesiest of tv shows in a long time jose ferrer played the title character nemo he did the part justice and certainly looked the part but nowadays it strikes me that the nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to captain bird s eye from the tv commercials or maybe it s the other way around his nemesis professor cunningham was overacted brilliantly by burgess meredith he never seemed to get over his penguin days from batman although he doesn t do his penguin quack here he is without parallel as the maniacal professor only john colicos of battlestar galactica fame chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot i never can recall what the grudge was between nemo and cunningham but it must have been severe since the prof never missed a chance to try and scupper nemo and vice versa the effects were nothing special though prof cunningham s submarine was way better looking than nemo s it also had a crew of strange fish like amphibians that served cunningham and did his every bidding however the most memorable aspect of the whole show was prof cunningham s secret weapon the delta beam he was forever saying fire delta beam whereupon a fishy crewman would horribly overract the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug truly priceless they don t make them like this anymore and perhaps just as well but like other series of this era for those who remember it it will always have an affectionate if cheddar covered place in our hearts 
786,the story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie then the story gets more and more outrageous the main character portrayed by marina sudina is fantastic and had a difficult role this could have been a super great movie had the ending been more realistic 
465,what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed 16mm stag film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to re visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings since an 8 8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd i am by no means a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70 s 80 s but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the then illegal stag loop 
905,i watched this film because i noticed that it had kari wuhrer in the cast i have long had a theory about her that she is a talented actress but never seems to get to prove that because she is always in this sort of low budget b movie she is still beautiful and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material i always see her in this is no different the film is often ugly and disturbing but that doesn t make it good george wendt played against type and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role another note about ms wuhrer her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since i saw her last perhaps reduction surgery or more likely removal of implants this not a bad thing she still looks great i would like to see her in a better movie 
189,this is one of my all time favourite films its one of those films where i know every line but can still watch it repeatedly without losing interest i always throw on this film if i m going on holiday or if i don t want to go to the gym just seeing nikki s gorgeous body will give me the motivation i need its an easy to watch film which always keeps me smiling but i know it wont be everyones cup of tea but if like me you love films that are shot beautifully and have comedy romance and an interesting plot you will love it it is filled with great characters and ben and nikki are both gorgeous so anyone can stare at something appealing bottom line you have to give it a try i watched it on tv one day by fluke and loved it that i had to go out and track it down which took some time and i could watch it everyday my father the hero i love you 
323,looking backwards to that year 2002 when furia was made one can easily recognize the heralding sings of today s new generation in romania the main qualities of furia stand in a very solid script with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing plus a cast of excellent actors all four leading roles are admirably performed both with depth and casualness dragos bucur and andy vasluianu confirmed since then being two of our best performers today dorina chiriac follows them closely and adrian tuli a non professional in real life a graveyard manager cast as gabonu was a genuine revelation further radu muntean s directing is skilled and expressive creating in a very compelling style that feeling of a fateful night and inescapable destiny one can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments since time proved them to be only the uncertainties inherent to a debut never repeated in his subsequent movies h√¢rtia va fi albastr√§ and boogie 
431,if bob ludlum was to see this mini series he would have cried this was complete waste of time and money i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was ludlum s work may be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series was poor mira blair anjelica and colm why did they sign to stoop this low horrible 
766,as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time second only to the breakfast club the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time it s underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people it comes on tbs maybe once a year but sometimes longer the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious with only a few comic scenes in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time i ve never heard this many great songs in one movie before there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin hes in high school who has a couple of best friends his two friends are sex sarved teens the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures that are very funny gary is major in love with the new girl in school he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her he also cheats on the side you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much you can feel it even more in the second half gary s friend turns out to be a creep but his other friend is pretty cool the movie shows how mean people can be you can relate to a lot of this movie the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy but it s so much more than that it s a very honest movie it s also very 80ish which i love if you love the 80 s or grew up in the 80 s rent this movie but there may be some people that don t like the 80 s but still may like this movie i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think it s very entertaining and very funny it combines very touching moments with very funny moments it s an underrated gem i have the movie i love it i give the last american virgin 1 2 out of 
528,now i ll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie that about sums it up too i disliked this movie to be more specific i disliked the concept of this movie the cinematography was good the mood was nice and the acting was satisfactory however the story is fatuous unacurate and misleading it is also offensive i am a quarter cree indian and for some reason i feel insulted on a personal level by the nature of whitaker s character first of all he s a black guy and this isn t a racist remark i swear the thought of a white hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents the katana represents the soul of a samurai imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside and where the heck did he get a katana anyway it must be one of those replicas which insults the samurai caste even more also ghost dog showed no honor near the end of the movie he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy it s more like a ninjas way silent assassins a group that samurais deny exists but hates none the less then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out his boss is a baddie you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable he kills himself to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to bushido so we have great cinematography good ambiance and so so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it making it an unsatisfactory overall film and an insult to everything a honorable bushi samurai holds dear 2 5 10 bleah
572,i wasn t at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit hostel and most of these lame ass knock offs are just as bad or worse yet live feed managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings followed by some good death scenes involving the chinese organized crime squad and a 7 foot leather aproned butcher what put me out of the movie was the tough hero with the guns and a grudge saving the day i would call this movie mediocre at best since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater doubling as a hideout for the mafia is appealing to me if only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective then my rating would have differed greatly unfortunately most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge type scenario so basically it is just a low budget hostel rip off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex almost constant during the first half of the film overall i would say don t bother with this one 
722,i feel as though i know these people and have known people similar to them these days though people are discouraged from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness it has a slow beginning but then look out if you love romantic comedies but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change or at least did have back in the 70 s then you should see this movie 
258,i loved this movie it is a definite inspirational movie it fills you with pride this movie is worth the rental or worth buying it should be in everyones home best movie i have seen in a long time it will make you mad because everyone is so mean to carl brashear but in the end it gets better it is a story of romance drama action and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in i love a lot of the quotes i use them all the time they help keep me on task of what i want to do it shows that anyone can achieve their dreams all they have to do is work for it it is a long movie but every time i watch it i never notice that it is as long as it is i get so engrossed in it that it goes so quick i love this movie i watch it whenever i can 
75,i thoroughly enjoyed a man called horse when it was released in 1970 but return played like a typical sequel everything about it budget script plot casting and acting was inferior to the original gale sondergaard as elk woman an elder of the yellow hand tribe looks nothing like an indian and neither do half of the other indians who were played by italians mexicans and latinos with cheap wigs and the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors he even used the bow like a woman finally richard harris who did such a superb job in the original seems to be coasting this time around i guess he couldn t resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as horse to be fair there are some interesting moments in the movie such as horse s undergoing a painful purification ritual to find his vision and rally the yellow hands against their indian enemies and white oppressors but on the whole return is uneven boring corny and predictable just like most sequels 
652,when you think of golf movies you think of caddyshack but what if there are kids around go right to this movie disney uses is proved formula to make a movie that the adults and the kids will enjoy the acting in this movie in my opinion is quite good and the leading cast for the most part is very young this movie is also suprsingly filmed very well and unique seeing all the angles of the golf game i think this movie should be up for some academy awards for film editing or something like that because the entire flow of the film is top notch though the ending might be a little predictable the movie does well on its own it also shows that you do not need swearing nudity or violence to make a great golf movie

942,after citizen kane in 1941 hollywood executives turned their cob webbed backs on the great orson welles with the exception of kane welles lost all creative control on magnificent ambersons journey into fear and many other films to come welles was an innovative and creative genius the most unconventional of filmmakers when hollywood was in need of a few more the lady from shanghai is yet another example of the misunderstood view of welles films at the time a movie that seems a bit choppy and non fluent it has a conventional 1940 s premise told in a most unconventional way and i am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor it is now legend that columbia mogul harry cohn stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about in hindsight many old grumps that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master story telling of orson welles and the lady from shanghai is only nearly great because of their intrusion beside being arguably the greatest director of all time welles was also quite a performer as an actor at 25 we all know what he did as charles foster kane perhaps the most famous character in film history here he inhabits a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence something unfamiliar to those familiar with welles other great work instead of a slick wise tongue he speaks with a rough irish twang rita hayworth his unhappily married wife at the time plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disillusionment he is a large lug who may have even murdered a man but the real mystery lies in the relationship between hayworth with stunning blonde hair and crippled hubby everett sloane mr bernstein from citizen kane a creepy partner of sloane s is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has welles michael o hara head spinning welles narrates the picture as o hara but things are still unclear throughout see for yourself and realize that it takes at least 2 viewings to fully know exactly what s up an uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around o hara with sloane defending him it is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods including sloane cross examining himself i didn t really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway up to this point the cinematography is great some scenes are shot with craft and skill aquarium love scene but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us the audience in reportedly the court scene was re shot against welles requests 10 closeups of hayworth were ordered and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at cohn s insistence a gaudy score infuriated welles who once again was left out of the editing process thank welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tour de force ending that will always be treasured the so called hall of mirrors scene brings buffs back time and time again rightfully so it must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented the crash of the mirrors represents o hara s disillusionment and the crazy house itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration it seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed crazy twisted and turned like a dali painting this is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the afi s top 100 then again 3 or 4 more of orson welles films may have made all collective best of lists if he had been left alone to create his own magic note look for the mercury players that are so prominent in welles pictures they pop up all over rating 8 of 10
108,the next karate kid in my opinion is an excellent martial arts flick i thought that eric chris conrad and julie hilary swank looked good in their prom attire to me ned michael cavalieri was a real bully this was because he got julie in trouble with principal wilkes eugene boles if you ask me colonel dugan michael ironside was a pure a this was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn t tolerate mistakes my favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between julie and the alpha elite in conclusion i highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial arts flicks or are fans of hilary swank 
246,this movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared as in was it as stupid as revolver i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense jason stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose within the first 10 minutes he s given a proposition by andre 3000 and big pussy of soprano s fame which makes no sense at all then there s some shooting and then there s ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs then there s some animation ray liotta s naked butt lots of shooting teeth gnashing art house wanna be pretensions and more of liotta s embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing which i m not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for not 5 times anyway everyone in this movie thinks they re smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks he s yogi bear incarnate the story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight the only way this movie could have been worse is if madonna herself was in it 
439,that s how i was when i walked staggered out of this film i couldn t leave because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people i was stuck in the middle trapped the tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen the daughter was a stand out performance stand out in the bad sense thge cinematography was hideous consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting i ve witnessed as for the stock footage well at first one wait why am i reviewing this film why do i acknowledge its existence please don t watch it do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry 
298,this extremely bargain basement blaxploitation kung fu hybrid was in my country released by a questionable dvd label that usually speaking just occupies with the transfer of pure crap onto disc so that wasn t exactly a favorable herald several other titles were released in the same series like the black six the black gestapo and the black godfather and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews none of these belong to the elite of the 70 s blaxploitation hype neither tnt jackson is a pretty lousy film completely lacking a significant plot but featuring far too many laughable fighting scenes and horrible acting to compensate apparently roger corman never too embarrassed to make some easy money assigned two of his most loyal acolytes to rapidly invent a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of both oriental kung fu movies and contemporary trendy blaxploitation flicks the result cirio h santiago and dick miller came up with was tnt jackson the tale of an arse whooping black babe traveling to hong kong in search of her missing brother she quickly discovers he was killed by a criminal network of drug smugglers and swears to avenge him mrs jackson smoothly infiltrates into the underground and encounters macho pimps helpful undercover agents loads of vicious kung fu fighters only one thing s for sure they all want a piece of tnt s ravishing body in one way or another i sincerely doubt movie concepts get any more elementary than this but unfortunately all the other aspects suck too the battle scenes are overlong and moreover pathetically staged jeannie bell and the other poor suckers try really hard to stare menacingly and assume a tough position but eventually all they ever do is kick in the air and stupidly leap across rooms the cinematography is horrid the soundtrack is vastly disappointing whatever happened to soul music the few dialogs are poorly written and the acting performances are inferior speaking of which jeannie bell is undeniably a beautiful woman but still she can t hold a candle to tamara dobson or pam grier there s only one really good and memorable scene in tnt jackson namely the famous hotel room battle where bell entirely naked except for panties repeatedly switches the light on and off whilst kicking the hell out of some goons amusing scene i just haven t figured out yet whether it s thanks to the light switch ingenuity or bell s perfectly shaped breasts 
776,i m not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cain s novel the postman always rings twice i m not even sure if viscounti acquired the book s rights but the resulting movie is definitely interesting it is not the best version of cain s story i like the 1981 version best but thanks to visconti s excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti a very sensual couple it is a must for noir fans visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect the film is not perfect though my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good the story moves at a very slow pace i don t think visconti was very good at editing his films i think film noir works better with a short running time fortunately calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested anyhow as much as i like this film and the remakes i think no one has made the definitive version of cain s much praised book 
493,i was expecting a lot better from the battlestar galactica franchise very boring prequel to the main series after the first 30 minutes i was waiting for it to end the characters do a lot of talking about religion computers programming retribution etc there are gangsters mafia types who carry out hits however caprica doesn t have the action of the original series to offset the slower parts let me give you some helpful advice when viewing movies as a general rule if there is a lot of excessive exploitive titillation then you know the movie will be a dud caprica has lots of this the director writer usually attempts to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing in a few naked bodies it never works and all it does is demean the very young actresses involved and i feel sorry for them directors writers who do this should be banned from the business if you want to be bored for an hour and a half by all means rent caprica there s free porn on the net if you really want to see naked bodies otherwise move along nothing to see here 
628,just after watching the first one and it is very dumb i happened to watch an episode of bones first and then the eleventh hour the 11th hour should be embarrassed it is so weak stewart introduces himself as a government scientist no mention of what kind of scientist just general sciency stuff in a program about cloning they bring a caretaker who was paid to dispose unsuccessful embryos to a church and made him kneel before the statue of jesus on the cross and ask forgiveness and as well tell them where the bad guy is so as they can move the plot on now thats science at work there is a dumb not good dumb bit where picard rages at a tv that advertises skin scream that makes you look younger shouting it s a lie as his randy female assistant gets groped by the local hot bobbie next door the end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady named after pinnochios daddy in order to move the clunky plot along waves at picard from the street as she gets in a taxi picard is one floor up and he looks out a window wistfully going she got away he could like try to run down or maybe ring the cops or maybe get the number of the taxi and ring it in or maybe had anything other than i am waving and getting into a taxi now and there is nothing you can do about it until next week ending mahhahahahah pity it s so stupid at one point a grieving father is convinced by picard that even if a replica clone son was born it would never be his son as his son had a soul yes that s right folks the general scientist argues against cloning on the basis that every soul is unique and sure why else would you want to clone although the general scientist picard finds cloning a bit gooey he s all up for stem cell research and goes as far as to say that calamity will befall humanity if it isn t allowed he has a pretty strident rant about how important it is of course he doesn t mention a single example that kind of sums up the show buzz words and tawdriness :(
349,oh my god it just doesn t get any worse than this i always love silly little sci fi b movies that are so stupid they are funny and i thought that this would be one of those but this was just so stupid i found it absolutely deplorable that it was allowed to be released what were these people thinking they are obviously not real filmmakers and i really hope that they have gone back to their day jobs after realizing that this is the best they could do the acting and the not so special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest budget b movies and what is with the men dressed up as women could they not find any women that wanted to appear in this crappy thing no probably not i would give this a 0 if possible it does not even deserve a 1 for awful do not waste your time and especially not your money on this horrible loser of a non film 
13,passing stones definitely one of the best comedy independent films ever you must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one this film for some reason hasn t received its credit due first lets start with the story line everyone loves a good treasure hunt when a dead father leaves letters behind advising of a hidden treasure it not only brings two families together but starts a whirlwind adventure mix in a polish translator a comatose mother a crack head with turrets syndrome a twisted homosexual hypnotist and one drag queen money not only makes the world go round but can turn family into enemies my favorite character in this film would have to be the sister crack addict with turret s syndrome her sudden out burst will have you crying and mimicking for weeks 
611,alright a sci fi horror action b hybrid directed by jim wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people as with any wynorski flick he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don t lead to anywhere but storm trooper is more like a two movies for the price of one kind of deal on the one hand we got the drama thriller part as such the film opens with carol alt killing her incredibly annoying ungrateful husband a plot that simply leads to nowhere and on the other hand we got the escaped cyborg on a rampage part night of the living dead style with carol and the cyborg being the ones trapped inside the house and a bunch of special ops bounty hunters playing the role of the zombies trying to break into the house needless to say this flick is not up there with the greatest zach galligan of gremlins fame especially is painfully bad and corey feldman in a small supporting roll is once again completely wasted on this movie wynorski even rips off one of his own movies here since i am 99 sure he used some stock footage of his previous film 976 evil ii the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle yes it s so not good and so much fun this is strictly for wynorski fans only and i am one of them in case you didn t know already 
367,i m not a writer or an critic i m just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago and i want to thank people that worked on creating this movie it is not the best or the most but it touched my heart why i would like to understand it myself it is easy and accessible it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret about the time wasted on watching it it is about love and caring about the life that we have but we miss it sometimes because of material stuff look at all the time that we have but we miss it why a fu k do we do that we need to live like were dying care about every second and remember if we do good things good things come back to us happiness is real and it has a special taste in new york i love this town and the world the we live in thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes english is my second language 
219,having just seen walt disney s the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man ub iwerks the colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one s off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone are just as funny as the previous short it does get a little repetitious near the end still skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony 
477,just watched this after my mother brought it back from america for me was dreading watching this after all the negative comments on here but i have to say yes the acting is cheesy some of the effects are laughable but you have to remember this was meant to be 1898 not 2005 and for such a low budget i thought it was quite good i enjoyed this version much more then the spielberg version i saw last week i have read the book so many times and found myself going ahh yes that s in the book almost all the time with the other version hardly anything of the book existed so well done for at least trying to make a true version 
244,the one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel was i would never get the time i used to watch this back again if you want to see stacey keach and michael dorn try and earn what must have been then the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned wooden acting poor special effects the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie the opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment nicole eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds whilst the police military and joe public don t cotton on that the woman drinking coffee dosn t use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once she must obviously be from another planet just where i wish i was when this movie was on 
638,seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn t quite meant to be i watched the first two fight scenes listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren and all of the other thrown in oriental actors and i found the movie so awful that it was funny then brandon lee enters the story and the one liners start flying the plot falls apart the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it s welcome as it turns into the worst action movie ever lungren beats out his previous efforts in the punisher and others as well as all of van damme s movies seagal s movies and stallone s non rocky movies for this distinct honor this movie has the absolute worst acting check out tia carrere s face when she is in any scene with dolph that s worth a laugh with the worst dialogue ever brandon lee s comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film and the worst outfit in a film dolph in full japanese attire picture tango and cash with worse acting meets commando meets friday the 13th because of the senseless nudity and lungren s performance is very jason voorhees like in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie the good how about not awful performances go to the bad guy who still looks constipated through his entire performance and carrere who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing brandon lee is just there being lungren s sidekick and doing a really awful job at that an awful awful movie fear it and avoid it if you do watch it though ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non underwater shots speaking of the underwater shots check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight scene ending ever this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill in between the flashes of nudity a bad bad movie 
261,late night on bbc1 was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporary set irish film so i stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end i have to admit that the main attraction was the only english actress kelly reilly who is stunning to look at this is billed as a black comedy which is one of the hardest things to pull off it should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you don t know why you re laughing for me martin scorsese s after hours 1985 is the best example dead bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness i didn t spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so i was suitably surprised as a snapshot of the irish film industry in 2003 it all seems rather worthy it doesn t look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back the script could ve been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good i m glad i watched it flaws and all tho i don t think i learnt much about ireland today especially their policing methods 
469,major spoilers this is for people who have seen the movie commenters have touched on the major theme of honor in the film and too many comparisons to braveheart i ll point out a few things about this movie that i have not seen other comments touch on this movie has a decidedly different take on abortion the first character to get pregnant is the villain s roth girlfriend and when he coldly suggests an abortion she states it is too late for that the shame of her situation i m to have a bastard s bastard leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene the second character to find herself pregnant is mary rob s wife after a rape by roth s character and at least one sex scene with her husband rob late in the movie as rob is leaving for a final confrontation with roth mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins with a tone hinting of abortion rob replies in a noble tone it s not the fault of the child and then states what he thinks the name should be girl or boy i find this pro life stance on the part of the hero to be very un hollywood rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment not coincidental symbolism another related theme is roth s character is a bastard someone who evidently does not know who his father was and has few kind words for his mother though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck is it coincidence that roth devoid of family stability is the walking definition of psychopath while rob is the strong husband father figure and of course the hero in the final sword fight between rob and the villain roth the former slices the latter deeply across the chest the left side of the chest over the heart his employer and pseudo father figure john hurt character holds the mother s picture in his hand and gazes at it before snatching it from the neck of the dead roth also what i find interesting was the direction of the rape scene which was not quite graphic but neither was it off camera and implied i found it surprising in it s somewhat matter of fact depiction with mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal and subsequent post traumatic stress as we call it now my point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied which i find an interesting middle road for hollywood to take in the final fight scene i have to correct an earlier commenter the weapon roth chose was a rapier or perhaps a short sword the weapon rob chose was a claymore someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene roth would have the upper hand in such a situation but of course the claymore is a distinctly scottish weapon what is even more striking to me as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made the actors seem actually trying to kill each other not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights including the movies opening fight even more true to history roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon which is it s purpose by design rapiers were edged but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust rob uses the claymore in broad slashes as it s design intent the fight goes down as i would expect it to roth effectively wins though rob wins the day by grabbing roth s weapon more symbolism and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut folks it is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight i ll also note that for whatever reason i remember 1995 the year of release distinctly as a time of distrust of the u s government hollywood was obviously tuned into that with the release of both rob roy and braveheart and i think the anti government leanings are why both films get so much comparison i think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans tired of the same old not so hidden messages from hollywood 
475,i went to see this film over matchstick men in fact buying the tickets to matchstick men and going to the other because it looked like a fun movie with action romance thrills jungles and exotic locations they had all that but so do a lot of movies with a conception of story all i can say is why why why why did they not just make it a straight narrative instead of some sappy flashback story here is all the movies from what i ve seen the film was derived from of course indiana jones and romancing the stone but also true lies proof of life that old 80s tom selleck movie bananas woody allen and hero from the use of digital extras ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 
373,this film launched my theory about films based on books instead of following the cliche you ve read the book now see the film if you are looking for a good book to read try one upon which a movie you like was based because it ll be 10 times better i saw this film on its initial release at the national theater in downtown eugene and liked it so much that i stayed to see it again it s a perfect merger of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors jon voight with what became my favorite book the water is wide by pat conroy i can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life two tiny caveats 1 the video suffers severely from pan and scan and deserves a letterbox version 2 the title should be restored to the name of the book a reference to one of the most touching enigmatic songs ever written:(
443,this is the first out of the guinea pig series and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date so i popped this sucker in and sat down from what i had read on the internet and realizing the content involved in this film i was expecting to test my nerves in full force this ended up not being the case the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point and how long a human can tolerate pain sounds like one sick flick right wrong the film fails to shock this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence including the ripping out of fingernails intestines thrown at an unconscious woman and a needle through the eye overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one 
47,very bad very very bad as a fellow who aspires to make be in or at least sniff the catering table at a movie set i find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made however this movie oh dear realizing frightworld doesn t aspire to anything more than crude exploitation an honorable thing in itself and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake and to be fair it is more entertaining than say red zone cuba but not by much so i won t try to critique just let me ask throw out some observations 1 if gore is the point of the movie shouldn t you be able to see it 2 if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment 3 in a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll difficult i know but really 4 there is a lot of talented videographers in the buffalo rochester area most you can hire really cheap get one who knows how to frame a scene 5 just because you have someone who knows how to use after effects and other cool programs doesn t mean he should do so every two seconds 6 kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time get girls who s tops we want to see taken off 7 editing should help tell the story or set a mood at the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags a chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary it s sloppy some good things not all the acting was bad jack was pretty good and i liked acid once she started fighting back there was some neat imagery unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason acid poptart is a name that deserves a better movie i like the moxie of frightworld too next time now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts i hope all involve aspire to something better than colman francis upgrade at least ed wood 
350,featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid solo seven pounds races past the director s previous collaboration with the actor the pursuit of happiness a flick which i also loved remember gabriele muccino s name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn t quite so high profile too bad i figured out will smith s scheme early on i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawson s character is introduced as having an incurable heart disease however i still think the writer director made the right choice putting the bookends bookends are the first and the last scene in that way it s the source of urgency and tension in the movie finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smith s and dawson s character flourish and develop knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smith s character could have a divine gift and i understand why his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones yet at other times he could be harsh and scary and when he s alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely it s quite a versatile performance lastly i can t forget to mention the crash scene re enactment which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music put this on your list 
639,bon voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the requisite silliness of a comedy with just enough sobriety to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome most importantly though the film is also historically instructive it captures the tension of the so called phony war and later the french aristocracy s flight from paris ahead of the german onslaught yet bon voyage is not a war movie it is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times bon voyage conveys the chaos confusion and emotional bewilderment of a nation of the brink of collapse and the wide spectrum of french reactions to the new political order this film is a comedy which entertains the audience a romance which skillfully utilizes many clich√©s and a story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them 
819,well it looked good on paper nick cage and jerry buckheimer collaborate again this time on a mix of heist movie da vinci code american history 101 and indiana jones but oh dear this is to indiana jones what speed 2 is to speed a reasonable cast including john voight and harvey keitel battles against a puerile script and loses badly the film is little more than an extended advert for the freemasons however these freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf these freemasons are the natural descendants of the knights templar and nobody mention from hell or jack the ripper i don t think i ve revealed any plot spoilers because there are none there is virtually no suspense no surprises and no climax it just stops national treasure aims for dan brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of scooby doo sans the humour 
660,in one of neil simon s best plays creaky cranky ex vaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special the problem is they haven t even seen each other in over a decade full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew rosetta lenoire as the nurse and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves trivia note the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler bessie love polly moran cliff edwards charles king gus edwards and the singing brox sisters 
682,how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it s terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it s so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i d rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they re the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create 
914,i am a great fan of martin amis on whose book this film is based unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen the novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development it is an hilarious examination of human greed excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary british writers the director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel in his hands the film screams along at breakneck speed indulging in every known trick shot and odd camera angle possible it is like ken russel on acid and suffers from that older director s self indulgence cranked up to a hundred not even the brief glimpse of gorgeous actor christian solimeno s penis was enough to save this wretched film for me abysmal 
236,gillian anderson is an arrogant driven career woman who picks up working class oik danny dyer for a night of fun after a stupid accident in the countryside they are brutally attacked after recovering and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers their thoughts turn to that of revenge i thought straightheads was terrible violent brutal misogynistic and unpleasant if i didn t dislike the phrase a great deal i would call straightheads a video nasty certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980 s frankly i don t know how straightheads got a cinema release i am not a prude i don t mind sex and violence in the movies but they have to be married to a movie with a a good plot or b good characterisation or c preferably both straightheads had neither no progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid luckily straightheads went nowhere fast it was only 80 minutes long it was a shame because there was the germ of an interesting film here with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third how often do i say this but it could have been good if it had been done properly what a shame i really like gillian anderson and danny dyer but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film she especially is very underrated and is still particularly fit if you want to see a good british revenge movie rent or buy shane meadows dead man s shoes it is a little masterpiece last weekend i should have seen his this is england instead ce sera sera 
632,being a genre film fan a child of the 80 s and a fan of hard rock music this movie holds a special place in my heart it has everything you could want in a supernatural movie action great special effects for 1986 and a guitar wailing glam rock soundtrack it certainly was the movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time i didn t see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here but it s popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it s cult status and eventually led to a sadly mediocre dvd release in 2002 if you re not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn t your cup of tea but trust me there are worse films of this type out there and despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations trick or treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare you ll never look at your stereo the same way again or should i say mp3 player trick or treat trivia marc price eddie played geeky skippy handelman on the popular long running comedy sitcom family ties after a string of direct to video flops including little devils killer tomatoes eat france and the rescue he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand up comedy recently he has been considering a tv comeback glen morgan roger is now a major hollywood producer screenwriter he has written and produced several major films and tv series including space above and beyond the x files final destination jet li s the one willard and most recently final destination 3 tony fields sammi started his performing career as a dancer on the tv series solid gold he appeared in several low budget films and tv shows before landing his breakout role as the devilish sammi curr in trick or treat sadly tony passed away on february 27th 1995 of aids related cancer doug savant tim is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twentysomething matt fielding on the popular sitcom melrose place since then he has had a long and varied acting career appearing in such films and tv series as the one godzilla csi crime scene investigation and the short lived joss whedon sci fi series firefly currently he can be seen as tom scavo on the smash hit series desperate housewives 
488,as a member of the cast i was a member of the band at all the basketball games i would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in oregon this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of oregon where it was shot seems that the u of o sign was shown while we were shooting we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff mr nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill mannered men i have ever met quite a time for a young 20 year old but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60 s and early 70 s despite what hollywood may think trombone player from oregon
965,this movie is essentially a how to on how to be a well connected pedophile i m amazed that so many people especially other gay men have seen this movie and read the book and no one has brought up the fact that if weber was not an influential photographer he would be in jail doing time for child abuse poor peter johnson weber took this poor naive although incredibly handsome teenager whom he found at a training camp for high school wrestlers in the midwest brought him to live in his home and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him many of them full frontal nudes all through johnson s teenage years that ain t art it s child abuse and what s worse weber made lots of money off of it and poor johnson is going to have serious issues the rest of his life weber s lecherous love of the boy is downright creepy as are his ramblings about famous and not so famous people he s known as he tries to complete johnson s education creepy and then just plain boring the only redeeming thing i can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self deception but i can t help but wonder why no one ever considered the effect this was having on chop suey weber s nickname for johnson himself 
408,it was a fun film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and the humour do work i must admit that you don t have to see it in a theater it will do very well on a small tv set tip see it with some close friends 
835,one of the most peculiar oft used romance movie plots is this one a seriously messed up man falls in love with a terminally ill woman who turns his life around before dying occasionally this story is done well and realistically as in the theory of flight an excellent weepie but more frequently it s done like it is here where as usual the heroine dies of old movie disease you know the terminal illness that has no symptoms but one fainting spell and a need to lie down as you re telling your lover goodbye forever and your looks aren t affected one bit and since this is the 70 s neither is your sex life this is one of the worst versions made of that particular story where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together and they re played by actors who are completely at sea this has got to be the worst performance of al pacino s career and i say that after having seen the devil s advocate only two days ago he plays a control freak emotionally constipated race car driver and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly he seems to constantly be asking himself why he s staying around the grating marthe keller so does the audience and spends most of the movie just standing there usually with his mouth hanging open the only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end where his character proves that he s changed from uptight to liberated by doing a hilariously bad mae west imitation hey it was the seventies marthe keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of say vanessa redgrave or julie christie instead they got the expressionless face and heavy german accent of ms keller who comes across as more of a scary teutonic stereotype you vill eat ze omelet than anything like lovable she s supposed to be reforming pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that but it doesn t work that way it s more like she s harping on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion this makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history where you can t believe she d be with someone she finds so worthless and you can t believe he s with someone who gets on his nerves that much some bad movie fans call this a cult classic mostly because of pacino s silly liberating mae west imitation the scene is a scream especially in context but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for no only see the film if you re a serious bad movie aficionado who is especially interested in studying extreme lack of chemistry between leading actors or very bad casting not only are the leads terrible but pacino s other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes keller with shorter hair i got them totally confused this isn t one of those laugh a minute bad movies like the conqueror it s just a really really bad movie 
343,i found the film quite expressive the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain things in life than people who mocked him his flatmate for example he was tortured and you loved to watch him being tortured it had this perverted side which was frightening but we were all happy to see him come out of the misery again it was like a game character or pan man through a mine land or to enemy and we love to watch him under sniper attack or fire but then at the end we are happy to see him survive 
472,1st watched 4 29 2007 4 out of 10 dir mick garris campy vampire like stephen king movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3 4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for king fans it s the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers a shape shifting feline like flesh eating life needing near extinct breed of humanoid who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive they come across as pretty normal upper class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home day and night cats are deadly to them so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down we get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack which is also a first in my movie going experience hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film the boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a sleepwalker and then he just wants her body there is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all out satirical comedy on suburban life but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish he d just get over it and bring out the gore eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it s typical stephen king downbeat ending the movie is interesting because king s humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesn t cut it 
584,this is complete and absolute garbage a fine example of what a bad movie is like this can t be appealing to anyone not even b movie fans do not i repeat do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash bad acting bad directing horrible but i mean really horrible script and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment of any form is i bought the dvd for 3 dollars i swear i could almost pay someone to take it burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me i like b movies the killer toys the weird lagoon monsters but this is nowhere near you know those movies that are so bad they are funny not even just plain old pathetic 
361,personnaly i really loved this movie and it particularly moved me the two main actors are giving us such great performances that at the end it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their characters the alchemy between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous and the song are just great the way they are that s why i didn t feel surprised when i learned it had won 5 golden globe awards the most rewarded movie at the golden globes an oscar and even a grammy this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone a great movie that has often been criticized maybe because streisand dared to get involved in it surely as a co director her artistry is the biggest and that will surely please you 
82,i used to watch pufnstuf every weekend when i was about 10 it was on right after bay city rollers i saw it come on to family channel one day and taped it for my then three year old daughter i d forgotten all the things i d loved as a child the magic flute the zoom broom witcheepoo s makeup this show is decidedly low tech the mayor is surely a precedent to mayor mccheese and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes but kids love this stuff they would way way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high tech computer animation there is mild slapstick but no adult themes such as sex or people dying and kids accept jimmy s schemes kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought witchypoo was flying overhead the music is old but you really get used to it and my daughter really loved it she used to sing different is hard different is lonely in the car my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months and it s still one of her favourites i see that a new pufnstuf 2000 is in the works i really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don t do anything like computer animating characters etc i think a whole new generation would love pufnstuf 
617,brando plays the ace jet pilot just back from shooting migs down in the korean war on leave he discovers his madame butterfly falls in love the lovers both see the folly of racism and the cruelty which conservative cultural norms can bring to human relations this film is an excellent romance with a nice twist which rejects the racist conservative standards dominant at the time it was made in 1957 sayonara will make you laugh and cry beware though sometimes the musical background will make you wish it was not there although irving berlin s title song will entice your memory for a very long time after your theatre lights come on again 
789, the cure is a very touching and poignant drama the film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends one of the boys has aids the boys become good friends despite erik s apprehensiveness at first the film shows the boys journey to discover the cure which is in ohio according to the national examiner and how it affects their relationship the acting is wonderful i have never seen annabella sciorra do better and the movie is just plain touching i couldn t stop crying with the shoe scene this is a good tearjerker keep the kleenex nearby 8 10
624,i got this movie in the 5 bin at walmart i would not recommend watching this move i might give it to one of my friends if i am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours i looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie i wish i would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on it was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie it s just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another the drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in vietnam okay here is my rant about this movie to me this movie is slow and hard to watch it was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end it doesn t after the movie was over i through it behind my t v because i was angry that i wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it 
836,the beatles had just done magical mystery tour there was the general feel that performance peace and drugs went together naturally in la there was a film subculture that knew something was up nicholson was in several of these gangs before he decided to seriously become an actor before easy rider before pink flamingos before day for night there were several experiments with what to do about this an important one is saragossa manuscript this is another jack writes he plays with circular narrative self reference film reference performance self loathing the pain of creation all on the outskirts of safe kiddiepop you must see this if only to know something about jack certain actors act by digging into themselves it is a common technique some dig deep but after a while they become boring because they are incredibly shallow people there isn t just enough stuff in there to sustain a career think of deniro and hackman others are pretty interesting people who seem to become more interesting over time when they dig into the barrel they put stuff back in because of the pain of the digging think sean penn and jack at the bottom of jack s barrel at the end of the thread he spins as the base of every character is this experimental risky writer filmmaker who cares if it is a bad movie it is bad because it took risks watch when a tear is wiped from annette s cheek by the director it is a loving goof on the whole brando thing something that i heard marlon laughed about that is one of the richest moments in hollywood film history there s another reason to watch this music in film is has a strong root in dance revolution in film often relies on music whole cultures are thus swept along an unsung giantess in inventing how billions now dance is toni basil she was as influential in pop choreography as the beatles were in music she was already well into her career when called upon to work on this but this is one of her earliest screen appearances you can see her work throughout and she herself in the pretty cool daddy s girl segment over one of nilsson s better songs followed by the frank zappa cameo mccartney would reference this scene in his teevee special years later a third reason to watch is early about 6 1 2 minutes in the film a character named lady pleasure kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then dismissively departs she is credited as i j jefferson but is really mimi manchu nicholson s lover at the time and lsd partner red hair psychedelic demeanor lovely that scene says it all for me about how jack feels about the boys ted s evaluation 3 of 3 worth watching 
708,i have to admit when i went to see this movie i didn t really have high expectations but even with my low expectations i was totally and utterly disappointed basically luke wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends there s slight mention of a girl stalking him but that s pretty much it for that character which i don t quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie so while on a subway rainn wilson who i actually liked before this movie convinces him to talk to a hot girl uma thurman this is strange to say the least as everyone can clearly see that uma thurman does not belong under the category of hot rainn wilson s performance is also far from hot normally i m all for his acting but even he couldn t salvage this movie his character was jumpy unrealistic and rather annoying you could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy or just desperate it was almost painful but anyway someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway and luke wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber now we all know that uma thurman is the superhero or g girl as they like to call her in the movie it still baffles me as to what the g stands for but we ll leave that for the message boards to debate the sex scenes i assume are supposed to be funny but i find myself asking who has sex like that they nearly throw the bed through the wall because of uma thurman s passion let s say it makes my head hurt but not in the i m thinking really hard to understand this way when uma insults anna faris calling her a whore i had no debate with that apart from the fact that she can t choose movies properly she can t act and relies souly on the fact that she s blonde and typical overall i would ve walked out of the theater if i hadn t paid 8 75 to see it the characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry especially uma thurman someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesn t mean you re acting also the script and storyline could ve used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid i actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors and their dying careers overall if you value your money and your self respect do not waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie 
824,i just caught an episode about brad the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started i have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart breaking than his drug addiction here s this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an olympic training team for two weeks and immediately upon arriving he insults lance armstrong one of the greatest athletes who ever lived and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general understandably he is soon asked to leave most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back but what i wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass at any rate i was confused about how the show was put together since it shows brad at the height of his addiction we see footage of him pan handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine i didn t even know that was legal to show but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good tv episode at any rate it is an enlightening show because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people s lives sometimes it s hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict s indifference although i have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean cut there are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost but still and maybe i should warn about spoilers here everything has a little too much of a happily ever after feel at the end and i have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life but still it s a show about people trying to help other people and you can never complain too much about something like that 
549,usual awful movie i ll not bother you about the synopsis just put together the core armageddon an evil planner military officer and one or two solve all nukes and you ll have the movie if i can call it that way seriously nukes in this kind of movies are more useful than swiss army knives the big one is approaching nuke some places and it s over a tornado wants to destroy insert important city name here nuke insert another important city here a volcano is erupting nuke it a nuke is near to go off nuke it coffee is cold nuke it you didn t like transformers nuke yourself but i can t assure this will fix things in the end how many more movies like this can be made before they start copying one another i doubt there are still many things to blow up with a nuke 
85,a young basketball playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses he hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging he s pressured into concluding his research because he hasn t published so the university is having trouble justifying funding him i think he does a trial injection on a monkey which quickly dies he then tries it on himself he starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy she s the one who had been demanding results from the research initially he seems to have no effects from the injection except some new strength he then realizes that he had some memory loss and starts recalling what happened additionally he starts to appear very unhealthy since the movie is named metamorphosis he does eventually change into something else you won t believe your eyes either what he turned into or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he s turned into incredibly there s a further change in store the end of the movie is really really absurd about the only thing this movie has going for it is that laura gemser is in it but she has a very small part i d once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up the main character s eyes occasionally turn green in the movie the copy i watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic which had been removed the novelty boxcover if it still had it would have been the only reason i would have held onto this movie i m definitely getting rid of it 
627,this film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes whether they are wearing clothes or not the strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of shakespeare as joseph papp discovered back in the 1950s in central park shakespeare s plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present and so the classic tales of cross dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as twelfth night and a midsummer night s eve and as you like it are used to good effect in this film all the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes and the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of bend it like beckham another charming coming of age movie 
663,i cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is suffice it to say anytime i m depressed about how unfair or futile things seem this is the movie i go rent to put me in the right frame of mind the background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness the indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard and is happy as a result persifina the laundry co worker of ruby s ashley judd is another her eyes and smile could make the hardest person s day i watch this movie and i dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends and i realize that being alone ruby is alone quite often isn t the same as being lonely recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull of a movie 
152,one of john s funniest eugene levy is great in this one as well just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on dvd i have it on video tape but feel that this film deserves dvd and extras would be great the kung fu uuniversity kung fu u skit is so very funny as is the entire film also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are great this movie never seems to be on tv but it loses most of it s hilarity when edited for broadcast tv if you can find the video i would suggest you buy it ebay is a good place to find a copy i will keep my vhs until one day we get to see it on dvd there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to dvd and this is one of them 
188,cheech chong s next movie 1980 was the second film to star to pot loving duo of cheech marin and tommy chong the lovable burn out smokers are now roommates they live in a condemned building looking for ways to score more smoke and just lay about all day but cheech is the responsible one he has a job and a steady girlfriend one day cheech wants to get his freak on so he tries to get chong out of the house another problem arises as well cheech s brother red cheech is another role is in town and wants to hang with him firguring that he could kill two birds with one stone cheech pawns chong off and red what kind of adventures will chong and red get into will cheech get his freak on how long will chong go without some smoke just watch cheech chong s next movie to find out tommy chong takes over the directorial reigns for the sequel he received some experience when he did some uncredited work on up in smoke funny but not as good as the first film but cheech and chong fans will enjoy it followed by nice dreams recommended 
91,i bought the dvd out of a big bin for 4 99 thinking i d lucked into some documentary pearl that would actually show extensive footage of the karakoram mountains and k2 in particular fast forwarding through the film i reached the climactic scene in which the climbers catch their first sight of mount waddington towering to all of 13 260 ft in canada s coastal range at least one of the several bozos geared up to climb k2 clearly has no idea what the real mountain actually looks like he has to be assured by his friend and climbing partner that he wouldn t have been brought by said partner to an ugly mountain given that one of the film s premises is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on k2 you might think that the jerk in question might have taken a minute or two to bone up on a few basic facts but the clown seems to think that preparations on this scale while good enough for the likes of reinhold messner are beneath him to be honest i haven t watched the whole thing what i ve seen makes me cringe they say that you get what you pay for at 4 99 i ve been ripped off 
566,they give you the set up then bore you to death with a constant cat and mouse chase the main characters are involved in one constant stand off where they threaten each other every five minutes or less and i d like to see the police force that would let one of their cops pull off the a garcia bit it s like some local cop walking charlie manson out of prison to go get a cup of coffee get real 
702,the title says it all i m not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie obviously this movie didn t have a multi million dollar budget but the plot was very well done the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd i ll definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films dylan o leary cast and crew i thank you 
920, in the tradition of carrie and heathers try a shameless ripoff of not only those two films but the evil dead and the shining as well that said they really don t make bad horror movies like this anymore and that s a shame cause it s a gas rainbow harvest is the winona substitute here and although she barely does more than mumble her lines and occasionally scream you re ugly into her haunted mirror she s goth way before it s fashionable so you have to respect her and she s quite creative about it too accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black spray painted hawaiian punch guy hat eat your heart out cher karen black overacts a bit but she s not totally without dignity and you can t help but sympathize with her unless you re a certain friend of mine who asked who is that horse lips from m a s h the first time she came onscreen there are decent supporting performances by kristin dattilo as the square chick who befriends rainbow ricky paull goldin in his trademarked wisecracking hunk role and william larry darryl and darryl sanderson as some kind of pet undertaker or something but it s sad to see the once smokin yvonne decarlo reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the charlotte rae part the eighties were the heyday for hilarious mindbogglingly dumb horror movies like this and mirror mirror was one of the last of its kind definitely worth a look 
280,it s a beautiful film the scenes are well pictured anne revere s dialogs are really well written and inspiring the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives and the things it teaches makes it great and wonderful mickey rooney is great in the movie and his role goes through lot of emotional turmoil as the film progresses elizabeth taylor looks very pretty her scenes in the film are inherently poetic the way camera follows her and the way the music make you feel make every scene of her ethereally beautiful this movie has great spirit and a beloved cherished classic angela lansbury is quite amusing in her role though unrecognizable if you have seen her in role of m in the manchurian candidate donald crisp has done his father s role full justice and the script provides him with ample stuff to justify his role its a very nice film and a must watch for family and children an evergreen christmas favorite 
876,the opening credits are pure poetry and i have watched it several times it had a corny 20 s adventure feel to it of course kathy is gorgeous but that voice did she realize this was a talkie one word voice coach great film for chronic insomnia along with a bottle of scotch 
902,the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot as we have seen so many super people movies these years and in fact i really liked it as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didn t expect uma thurman performed as average in g girl s role surprisingly i was again able to watch her toes in wide screen like in the beginning of kill bill luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman i could really get into his situation if you want a light touch of fun you should definitely watch g girl s and average matt s adventures especially to cheer up your partner 7 10 in my collection 
710,travolta thurman the rock vaughn keitel and so on one should think that this star parade of great actors could really heat up this movie but no travolta takes on the role as chili palmer again but this time we have already seen the gangster who tries hes luck in the hard world of movie making its not funny anymore this is a typically problem in hollywood they think that if the first was good the second will be twice as good no the first was original the second cant be hey hollywood try to understand originality cant be duplicated you got to give us a new twist not just the same movie again made with a bigger budget i constantly found my selves hardly laughing when i was watching this movie but still it got a lot of cool actors like harvey keitel james woods vince vaughn and the rock and for that and that only 4 10
19,kusturika made it again another masterpiece a coral comedy full of his own landmarks with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments we laughed and laughed what a party the music is everywhere and also the shooting the animals the crazy bastards sex and amazing gadgets and inventions everything colorfully visual to entertain only pure cinema in essence a wonderful experience to watch and one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare and so wonderful well this is one and if you enjoyed kusturica s previous films you ll love this although as in all comedies it is about a chemical reaction and you have to be in the mood for it 
944,this is not a children s movie this movie is like a bad acid trip for kids under the age of 5 for a month my 4 year old from time to time would ask me why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth or why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits and that wasn t the worst of it we stopped it about a 1 2 hour in but the damage had been done intensely morbid oppressive violent fortunately he s finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges go ahead censure me my conscience is clear 
423,the cell is weak on plot filled with holes and has pretty lousy acting as well but none of this matters for director tarsem singh has given us one of the most visually stunning movies ever the whole plot is just an excuse to let tarsem fool around and take you into the minds of a serial killer bringing the audience some shocking pleasing breath taking and mind blowing images the images from this beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time to come this movie is a perfect case for the suspension of disbelief theory forget the silly plot just let your senses be overwhelmed with the images and j lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of tarsem s work the cinematography is harrowing the music haunting the costumes just stunning the movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art its just that the medium is not canvas anymore it is the big screen and celluloid one of the most refreshing movies of this decade the cell is a must watch a bold new step in movie making an enthralling 8 
952,one of the greatest lessons i ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way i was working in roger corman s offices like so many other wanabees before and since i was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable hah one afternoon julie corman roger corman s wife and a producer in her own right asked me to load up a tape i m not sure why she wanted to watch it i got the impression it was a student film or a show reel something like that some sort of calling card whatever the reasons she had to see it the only free video machine in the offices at the time happened to be in the room i was working in and i was the nearest person to the machine i started the tape fade in on screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera behind him screen left was a door that opened into the room against the far wall was a coat rack a second character entered through the door and started talking the first character the guy at the desk turned round to reply this is all one take static camera there are no cuts pans or dolly shots just one locked off camera the second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line julie corman said i ve seen enough and left the room what she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines nope sorry next that s how long you ve got ten seconds cock it up in the opening shot and you are dead i was reminded of that moment while i watched the opening of this piece of crap after an interminably long travelogue of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into cages a man carrying a gun laughs a jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal god this is boring cut to the interior of the airport two men meet aha something is happening they shake hands cut to a different angle of the two men and the director crosses the line the first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up not crossing the line is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience audiences don t like to be confused mystified baffled puzzled and intrigued yes audiences love all of those confused no you loose them they walk out not crossing the line is one of those things they pound into you at film school or should it s basic stuff it s not an inviolable rule there are no inviolable rules directors break it all the time but not on the first real cut of the movie i thought i ve seen enough and switched off 
438,after putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat scan a metal object in it s brain reacts adversely to the procedure thus freeing the spirit or phantom if you will of the mummy belphegor due to convenient circumstances lisa who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit soon enough she s stealing the museum s egyptian treasures out from under their nose detective verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief this is a serviceable enough if you haven t seen any other incarnations of belph√©gor before if you have i recommend skipping this particular version as it can t help but pale in comparison to the others despite the nice locals and scenery it plays out like a slightly higher budgeted sci fi original film and i don t really mean that as a compliment eye candy sophie marceau shows ass side boob my grade c dvd extras none
259,although its plot is taken from the history of ancient rome caligula is not made in the style of sword and sandal epics like spartacus or gladiator that style of movie making was out of favour in the late seventies rather it more closely resembles a cross between a soft core porn movie and a video nasty at least the shortened 150 minute version does i have never seen the full 210 minute version but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page it would seem closer to a cross between a hard core porn movie and a video nasty as one would expect from a film produced by the publisher of penthouse there is much naked flesh to be seen and the film lovingly catalogues caligula s sexual perversions including his incestuous affair with his sister drusilla what is perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones to many scenes the obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence as though bob guccione gore vidal and tinto brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone it is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called brass and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called gore characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape the emperor caligula and his predecessor tiberius were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles so the film s concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate i do however question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in roman history both the fall of the roman empire and gladiator were set during the reign of commodus an emperor quite as cruel and licentious as caligula in neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of up pompeii emmanuelle and the texas chainsaw massacre and both those films are artistically far better than caligula the acting in the film is not particularly bad with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden teresa ann savoy as drusilla malcolm mcdowell makes a suitably insane caligula suitable that is in the context of this film the real caligula was doubtless both cruel and eccentric but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill the great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished british actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production in the case of helen mirren the only dame of the british empire with a past as a porn star it was probably connected to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy but heaven alone knows what peter o toole and john gielgud thought they were doing unlike some other famous stage actors such as laurence olivier and richard burton gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of nerva a decent and honourable senator of the old school unfortunately in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill guccione clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence whether brass and vidal had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question the film does not however succeed upon any other level either as art cinema or as a study of the politics of dictatorship even seen as erotica it is second rate 4 10
671,spoilers this review has been edited due to word limit the horror the horror marlon brando apocalypse now 1979 and apocalypse now redux 2001 the sentence which is as famous as here s looking at you kid or are you talkin to me or may the force be with you or i ll be back means a little more than some one liners when it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed what might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame what exactly does this line of dialogue mean the horror spoken of is the reality of war the reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt when capt willard martin sheen stands before the dying col kurtz marlon brando at the end of the film the horror the horror is the realization of willard s corruptness he has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment this isn t a typical hollywood ending in most cases a character gains something whether it be emotionally physically mentally or all three but willard both gains and loses he gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals and that is a shocking ending apocalypse now is francis ford coppola s tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking this film is wholly different from the godfather it is hallucinogenic visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature at first it seems realistic and then it becomes strange and then symbolic and by the end original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare this is not as much a film about the vietnam war as it is a film about the war within us at first it does appear to be another war film captain willard sheen is assigned by an army lieutenant a young harrison ford to assassinate a renegade american colonel named kurtz brando who is hiding out somewhere in vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves willard carries out his mission with extreme prejudice heading out on a boat along with four soldiers including the boat captain chief albert hall chef frederic forest and a very young larry fishburne who later went on to appear as morpheus in the matrix apocalypse now is in a many ways a modern update of homer s odyssey as our main character willard carries on his journey he meets an array of original and strange characters including lt col kilgore robert duvall who has a strange fetish for surfing and a stoned photographer dennis hopper whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser jeremy davies in the million dollar hotel one of the worst films i have ever seen davies failed to make any connection with an audience hopper does he is like the poetic vibe between willard and kurtz he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages in this case he is translating kurtz to willard although i m not so sure kurtz needs a translation of willard many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines apocalypse now has many kilgore descending upon a vietnam village playing wagner s ride of the valkyries remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history there is sharpness to it a brutality to it an ironic tone to it and also a sense of playfulness when kilgore kneels down on that beach and says i love the smell of napalm in the morning it smells like victory we all crack a smile i won t lie to you apocalypse now is a strange film it isn t exactly the easiest thing to analyze the end may frustrate some viewers if they don t understand marlon brando s significant speeches but what it all comes down to what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche the horror is the realization of war and its effects not the war itself kurtz says you have a right to kill me but you have no right to judge me brando s character kurtz is left to the audience to judge to many na√Øve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head but that isn t what francis ford coppola is trying to get across by fighting in vietnam kurtz has realized just how great he had it and how bad some others had it by walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the na√Øve ones living our lives in a fool s paradise we are totally na√Øve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit by seeing how unlucky some vietnamese are kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something just how easily he could end up like the people around him and he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door many people think the horror is one thing it is two for kurtz the horror is the reality of how na√Øve he was and the reality of the war s impact upon men and after willard murders kurtz and hears kurtz s dying words he realizes it too he realizes the effects of war to see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man and what it has done to him the horror 5 5 stars 
791,this has always been a favorite movie of mine i ve owned a vhs copy and a couple of months ago i found a dvd release which is also part of my video collection i also happen to be a huge baseball fan and as part of my off season reading i picked up a copy of robert whiting s excellent book you gotta have wa that profiles the ins and outs of japanese baseball and the challenges that foreign players have encountered playing in japan as i began to read yesterday it made me think of this movie because it appears the screenplay was based almost verbatim on this book the parallels are uncanny the jack elliot character closely resembles bob horner an aging mlb slugger whose best days were behind him horner s teammate leon lee is also depicted in the character max hammer dubois a veteran in the japanese league who has made his peace with the frustrations of the japanese game and helps keeps his teammate sane the elliot character goes through the same sequence of encounters as horner from big fanfare signing early success that fuels an already ravenous sports media and the ensuing slump that spurs frustration alienation from teammates fans and media and the resulting disillusionment that prompts a desire to go back home to the us the only difference is that the movie adds such hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending speaking of love interests i m sure many viewers have come to this site as i did to look up the actress who played hiroko the beautiful aya takanashi and what other work she has done it only lists this movie it turns out based on an article i read that the brief love scene she has with tom selleck a foreigner in this movie mild by our standards basically they kiss while he s in the bath and she s wearing a towel caused such an outrage on the part of the japanese public males in particular that she has never been offered another role of any kind in movies or television essentially blackballed by the japanese movie industry it s a real shame as she is was quite a talented actress in this movie if you like this movie as much for the baseball elements and cultural differences as i did go find a copy of you gotta have wa by robert whiting a good read and a great companion book to this movie 
903,this film is outstanding on this date of apr 8 2007 it was on on demand from show time it had been a while since i seen it but it does feature thomas jane in the first role i seen him in at first you see a normal guy that seems kind of henpecked with a wife that seems close to going her own way the directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool paulina porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader type looking very fresh and hot trying to buy a coffee late at night with no small bills turns violent in a hurry paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal meeting up with his old road pal nick played by aaron eckhart was cool at first and he even loans him his wife s car to take care of some business then he spots nicks silver briefcase and the day changes for the weird and violent there is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes but paulina s dallas steals the show i think her telling of a casey story to the doctor that is there to get a personal interview in a adoption application is outrageous as a rule i have never thought tall women were that sexy but as with any rule there are exceptions paulina is as one has never seen her before in films sexy and lethal like in the one movie with tom selleck but with a never seen before malevolence if your looking for film to add to your collection this one is worth the price paulina in the nude is worth the price alone but this story has everything one might hope one has love friendship sex and violence in a terrific mix when i first seen it years ago it blew my mind and i know you will feel the same way 
491,john cassavette s decided as his first film obviously as one shot on a shoestring in new york to not even have a script with dialog and delivers a 1959 feature equivalent of larry david s curb your enthusiasm all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk in other words it s one of the most realistic looks at the beat generation jazzed sweetly in it s score and telling a tale of racial tensions a group of black siblings are the center point with one trying to get better gigs than the average strip club and has a sister much more light skinned than him who gets entwined with a white man in a relationship which shatters both sides the film however isn t exclusively about that cassavettes likes to have his characters wander around new york city which not many films did in 1959 1960 and his style of storytelling is like that of the improvisational jazz artists of the day dated to be sure but worth a glance for film buffs martin scorsese named this as one of his heaviest influences 
879,i saw conrack on a night i couldn t sleep and i was never so glad to have insomnia this story of a young white teacher who takes a position teaching poor black kids on an island in the carolina s is a great advertisement for teaching and for simply helping each other set in the early 60s with the civil rights issues viet nam and all that came with the 60s it is forgotten that the peace corps and many young people struck out to make a difference helping the unprivileged conrack with his open style of teaching is interested in these kids as people and encourages an honest interaction in his class that scares the power s that be the greatest part was that jon voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of those kids became teachers its enough to make you think we as humans may have a chance to survive ourselves maybe hopefully see this film 
901,my father the hero is sweet funny and cute gerard depardiu is awesome as andre a divorced father who takes his fourteen year old daughter nicole kathrine heigl to the caribbean for vacation while there his daughter meets a guy named ben dalton james to impress him she tells him that andre is her lover and that her father is in jail for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and that she ran off with her pimp everyone on the island is soon under the impression that andre s a child molester andre is between two relationships one with isabelle emma thompson who makes a cameo in the end of the film and diana faith prince from spin city my father the hero has many funny moments like when he s at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something french so he plays thank heaven for little girls from gigi everyone gets disgusted and leaves my father the hero doesn t deserve a 5 1 i think it deserves a 9 0 
67,first i d like to say that while i know my share about star wars i am not a fanatic i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427 what i know is this star wars all the movies less so with episode 2 though captured something magical it s hard to say what what button lucas has found and boldly pressed but it works star wars is more than a movie it s an idea how may you ask i shall explain star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes good vs evil it does this so obviously so profoundly that literally any person from any environment can understand episode vi does the very well concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father yet also with the addition of the prequels reveals even more to the hinted back story suddenly it s darth vader at the front and viewers realize that it s the story about anakin not just luke but even before 1 3 there was amazing depth to it all it felt real as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas s lap detailing a historical account of a galaxy far far away star wars is definitely something far above the norm and i must admit whenever i see them particularly this one i feel very small i feel as though i ve been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined i get a tingling feeling when i see them a feeling that something somehow has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope 
450,this movie must have looked when it was being pitched at development stage and getting a redgrave and a jacobi on board must have excited the money men all i can say is that they clearly did not have anything on that week jacobi camps it up in the way that only jacobi can do and i thought that he seemed to more of the actor that he parodied in his cameo role in frasier a few years back vinnie jones is not exactly bad he is just clearly out of his depth as a leading man he is really quite amiable throughout and if this was a pilot for a tv series it may have just got picked up however the scipt and the camera work were appalling quite why this jounalist and a press officer from the met would ever work together is never explained it certainly cannot have been because of the sexual chemistry of which there is none there is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far fetched plot that you can pass off as original but the whole thing is just so contrived that the two stories just do not make sense at all it was like two stories confusingly edited in to one just to make up two hours go watch some paint dry for a couple of hours you life will be more fulfilled than watching this rubbish
593,the ator series is a shining example of what b movies should be they fail in every aspect but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad ator l invincibile 2 aka the blade master aka cave dwellers shows us europe s favorite conan clone ator where we left him in the first movie after showing us a lengthy recap of all the events of the first film this time the world must be saved from the nucleus a kind of bomb represented on screen as a bright light i guess they couldn t afford a prop this one features invisible attackers and samurai as with the first film lots of stock footage is used including one rather obvious bit from star wars thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad this is an exception b movie 
809,i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience the imagination on display the visual interpretation of the script the humor is constantly surprising the two leads are great and really carry the film my advice would be to not even watch a trailer just rent the film and watch without expectations i rented from blockbuster so it is readily available in brisbane not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that s always good unless it s just that was stupid i loved this film you just don t get to see gem s like this every day this should become a cult favorite give it a try you may just feel the same way about it as i do 
676,this is an honest attempt to make a bewitchingly sweet love story the obvious inspiration behind the successful tv series bewitched this lovely sweet rom com is a timeless treasure the comparisons are obvious jimmy stewart plays a hapless but stolid straight kim novac plays a voluptuous blond witch who captures him through the use of a love spell but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch she contents herself with the duties of running her own shop and takes comfort in the fact that her beloved pyewacket her feline familiar is being cared for by her beloved aunt you ll recognize the aunt from murder by death this movie is fun and touchingly sweet bearing some spectacular wit and a nice witchy feel worth a look 
113,the haunting a remake of course the original was a creepy psychological thriller and one that has improved with time compared to this 1999 remake it s a classic there is no character development here only caricatures the slut the authoritative brain the i m gonna get us outta here fellow the oh so sensitive bookworm but seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the star i guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern unfortunately the effects are laughable mewing cherubs stretchy doors irritating dead children that can t speak plainly and an idiotically sappy ending that does it s darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows ill take my skittles orally thank you bruce dern i ve liked you since the cowboys stop it 
185,i understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and i am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible i ve been to the scottish highlands and found the lack of scottish accents in the characters disappointing this plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground i feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant if you want a silent movie that captures that presence try le dernier combat there have been very few movies that i couldn t even manage to finish and this was one of them absolute dribble 
147,it s not often i feel strongly enough to post something about a film this was however simply the worst movie i have ever seen the performances were laughable at best at worst they were well there s no other word for it awful especially the lead female who s random sexual come ons have to be seen and heard to be believed honestly the plot is nonsensical the dialogue appalling and the characterisation there is none i m surprised it s not an alan smithee film i can t stress this strongly enough avoid at all costs how do movies like this ever get made this is no budget film making at its very very worst 
2,i ve seen this piece of perfection during the fantasy filmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down i ve seen a lot of films but there are just a few that i d call perfect like koyaanisqatsi or fight club subconscious cruelty is definitely one of them half of the people went out of the screening in berlin and i can understand them absolutely this is not a movie for normal people with dreams and illusions a person that is living in his her dreams day by day not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this film if someone reads this now who has seen s c and also thinks it s great just contact me so far i haven t met anyone who shares my opinion it d be cool this film earns 10 points out of 10 finally i m really sorry for my bad english i m not a studied person und das ist auch gut so g :)
199,going down to south park is a 1hr long documentary about south park with interviews with trey parker and matt stone and all the other people who work on south park there really isn t much to say it shows the history of south park and what it takes to make one episode it is basically a behind the scenes of the show it shows the different merchandise that south park has made it was really comedy central who put it out it also shows the controversy which was caused by south park it shows plenty of funny clips from the show as well it s a fairly funny documentary any fan of south park should check this out you can find it on youtube 9 10
580,spoken like a true hard boiled u an gangsta the story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii or goodfellas it is not in the same league but what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these italian americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u an accent pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him i was looking forward to see abrahams and loggia but their steenky accents spoiled the fun ah well the script ain t too hot either don corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him smiling and patting him on the back all the while 
659,i love tudor chirila and maybe that s why i enjoyed the movie so much two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert i saw the trailer and the video zmeu before the movie and i thought i had it all figured i was wrong instead of a good movie i assisted a great one i felt the movie it was sad it was funny but most of all it pictured love i can t even begin to describe the soundtrack so i won t i m not a movie critic i can t describe it in more words my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless thank god for the keyboard thank you tudor giurgiu thank you maria popistasu thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila encore :) :) :)
979,if you love the thin man series you will love this movie powell s character of vance is very similar to his character of nick charles there are even dogs the chemistry between powell and astor may not be as fabulous as powell and loy but it isn t half bad 
758,saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun i mean the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness it was the first movie i watched with this theme drugs marijuana that is not really criticizing it only making jokes about it grace trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in u k and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide since he was full of debts the problem is that grace who imagined to have some money saved for her discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband s pounds in debts to not lose all of her things specially her house that she loves so much she never worked before and is in a tragic situation until matthew her gardener who is very found of smoking pot decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale 
748,the great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970 this twenty year spell can be rightly labelled the golden era of the genre there were musicals prior to that and there have been musicals since but the true classics seem invariably to have been made during that period singin in the rain an american in paris the band wagon seven brides for seven brothers oklahoma south pacific the king and i and many more stand tall as much cherished products of the age perhaps the last great musical of the golden era is carol reed s 1968 oliver freely adapted from dickens novel this vibrant musical is a film version of a successful stage production it is a magnificent film winner of six oscars including the best picture award orphan oliver twist mark lester lives a miserable existence in a workhouse his mother having died moments after giving birth to him following an incident one meal time he is booted out of the workhouse and ends up employed at a funeral parlour but oliver doesn t settle particularly well into his new job and escapes after a few troubled days he makes the long journey to london where he hopes to seek his fortune oliver is taken under the wing of a child pickpocket called the artful dodger jack wild who in turn works for fagin ron moody an elderly crook in charge of a gang of child thieves despite the unlawful nature of the job oliver finds good friends among his new family he also makes the acquaintance of nancy shani wallis girlfriend of the cruellest and most feared thief of them all the menacing bill sikes oliver reed after many adventures oliver discovers his true ancestry and finds that he is actually from a rich and well to do background but his chances of being reunited with his real family are jeopardised when bill sikes forcibly exploits oliver making him an accomplice in some particularly risky and ambitious robberies oliver is a brilliantly assembled film consistently pleasing to the eye and excellently acted by its talented cast moody recreates his stage role with considerable verve stealing the film from the youngsters with his energetic performance as fagin lester and wild do well too as the young pickpockets while wallis enthusiastically fleshes out the nancy role and reed generates genuine despicableness as sikes the musical numbers are staged with incredible precision and sense of spectacle onna white s oscar winning choreography helps make the song and dance set pieces so memorable but the lively performers and the skillful direction of carol reed also play their part the unforgettable tunes include food glorious food consider yourself you ve got to pick a pocket or two i d do anything and oom pah pah all immensely catchy songs conveyed via very well put together sequences the film is a thoroughly entertaining experience and never really loses momentum over its entire 153 minute duration sit back and enjoy 
86,so wynorski remakes curse of the komodo a second time this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists anti capitalists and he adds a cobra most of the movie is spent listening to the self righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there dna experiments were conducted critters started to grow people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks etc needless to say it would have been a much better movie if they would have made the flashbacks the movie and forgotten about the sanctimonious do gooders lest i forget there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holier than thou posse gets picked off one by one but they probably comprise less than 2 of the film the main event pitting our title characters against each other lasts about one minute and is as exciting as watching the previews for the latest dino crisis video game the acting is pretty bad overall even for this sort of film half the actors seem like they re more concerned with pronouncing every last syllable of every word than speaking their dialog in any sort of believable manner i actually did make it through to the end but it s one of those movies i wish i would have recorded and then watched later because there are plenty of parts that need to be fast forwarded through overall i give this effort one star it has absolutely none of the elements that make a b movie fun to watch it s a sad day indeed when you can say with sincerity that the makers of this movie could have learned a thing or two from watching boa vs python 
16,felix in hollywood is a great film the version i viewed was very well restored which is sometimes a problem with these silent era animated films it has some of hollywood s most famous stars making cameo animated appearances a must for any silent film or animation enthusiast 
424,i m disappointed that reiser who wrote the film felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever maybe that s his idea of adult films plenty of nasty words with bathroom humor thrown in i thought better of him and think less of him for this movie falk s acting and some moments of humor as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating this might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their foibles but the lack of consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been a family film but fails certainly not worth spending money on though it might be worth a watch for free on television 
773,this is a good time to say how good i think of this site it gives me the opportunity to feedback all the frustration i lived for two hours awaiting for something to happens for something to be said to be shown to be insinuated subtly for a symbol an idea whatever no just long endless violins alternated by a tired piano tired voices tired actors and bored characters and situations boring is the long death of the mind and this movie is from that point of view a public enemy how many thousands of live hours will be still stolen to another thousands of innocent spectators i don t claim for my money back just for my time and the time of persons i invited to watch this thing oh god 
527,if you have ever been has a friend or a kid that is or was into skating at one time then watch this flick i have seen it several times and i get something new out of it every time that i see it it reminded me of why i got into skating in the first place a long time ago it reminded me of what skating brings to a person and i have found will also help a person who doesn t understand why skaters well skate sure there is a very dark side to the whole seen which the movie does touch on slightly but it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating just a person on a board doing it because they love to do it this movie was so inspirational to me that i m now skating once again i m 32 and i haven t been this happy with my self in years give this one a go you will not be disappointed 
561,typical formula action film a good cop gets entangled in a mess of crooked cops and japanese gangsters the okay result has decent performances a few fleeting snicker inducing moments and some fair action sequences plus a chance to check out the gorgeous danielle harris who makes the most of her perpetual typecasting as a rebellious teen daughter out of 
553,terry gilliam s and david peoples teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the 90 s people s proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time i especially love the idea one can t change the past it s a nice counterpoint to so many time travelling movies which say otherwise biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness perfection and originality the story itself is engaging one man james cole played by bruce willis in a heart warming performance travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that s wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground with the information he ll collect scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface but because their time travelling technology isn t perfect he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists end of the millennium paranoia biological weapons the perception of reality and the definition of sanity with such a complex movie it was easy for gilliam and peoples to create a mess but instead twelve monkeys is a thought provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas i watched this movie once around 10 years ago it marked me a lot i remember still thinking about many days after wards for my young mind this seemed quite mind blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important i ve re watched this movie a few days ago on dvd and it s better than i remembered it brad pitt still steals all the scenes he s in playing jeffrey goines almost a prelude to his tyler durden character in fight club a rich kid with some anarchist non conformist ideas who s also crazy and according to cole perhaps responsible for the virus the scenes between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie pitt s eyes voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he s really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands pitt s oscar nomination was well deserved surprising was also bruce willis performance his i didn t remember very well but it s beautiful and full of sensibility he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground and when he comes to the past you ll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up cole is a rather ambiguous character peoples tried to imbue some darkness in him and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked ironically cole didn t start as a crazy character but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world he s considered mad and convinced it s all in his mind until he arrives at a point when he can t distinguish past from future reality from fiction willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure and it works perfectly one of the fun twists in the narrative is when cole s shrink dr kathryn railly finds undeniable proof he s really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace their relationship is also well handed although perhaps a bit compressed for time s sake but i enjoyed watching cole and railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past but then things end in a tragic bittersweet climax at an airport wrapping all the pieces together which will blow many minds away there are two great endings in this movie a twist in the sense of se7en or fight club and a more intimate ending where railly is crouching next to cole who s just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole who s witnessing his future self die the two share a brief look and she smiles at him the twist is brilliant but i prefer this ending for emotional impact madeleine stowe is very good playing dr railly she drew many different emotions from me in her performance the movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can t be changed this movie shows that in a terrifying way it reminds me of chinatown in that sense the way jake gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help railly s character shares that fatalism the more she tries to help cole first dealing with his madness then helping him in his mission the more they re sucked into tragedy the twist ends with a hopeful note though with the feeling cole s mission hasn t been in vain twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained it s not supposed to be art although it s more artists than many artistic movies it s an unpretentious movie where all elements from music to editing to costume design etc came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece 
865,i was first introduced to john waters films by seeing female trouble on ifc i was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it then i picked up the pink flamingos dvd in the john waters boxed set the movie is about babs johnson the filthiest person alive who lives in a trailer in maryland with her obese egg obsessed mother and her deranged son crackers in the movie you will see such sick sights as sex with chickens drag queens people eating feces torture and all other sorts of random humiliation the film has a soundtrack from 60 s rock and roll artists the only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and can get a little boring i found female trouble a little more fun rated nc 17 for explicit sex violence and disturbing images enjoy 
461, welcome to collinwood is kind of a disaster considering the people involved it should ve been multiple times better watching it if you re at least somewhat attached to the faith that it ll get better will probably make you cry it s one of those movies that had potential but was robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad acting not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary george clooney character and the guy who reminds me of richard dreyfuss but about whom i care so little that i don t even want to know his name the film s only saving grace is the weird con vocabulary it introduces i found myself thinking of it time and time again as i watched more crime capers this is the only reason i gave the film a 3 the plot is boring the characters are neurotic needlessly offensive and highly unlikable they are in a constant state of agonizing stress and they re all so irritating that i celebrated their obstacles they yell at each other and swear crassly the dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points i find that steven traffic soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and george clooney are to blame for this they should be tried for war crimes if anyone actually remembers this crap long enough to care 
797,uuuuaaa barf yuk yuk disgusting puke city worst piece of junk ever made sick weird horrible enough said hold your nose don t eat after seeing this sick demented garbage pail of a movie you won t be able to eat your food for a week but maybe that s good a new diet has been invented go to see this vomit inducing film get sick to your stomach and you will be so turned off by the whole mess that you can t eat for at least a week and you drop about 15 pounds me me lay with a name like this it s really amazing that she doesn t have a cult fan following she rates as the worst actress ever her films make ed woods look like gone with the wind this movie rates a minus 10 
697,except for the glossy look this show had little to recommend it the writing was patronizing and convoluted without exception the characters were shallow and unsympathetic the female characters came off the worst reduced to spoiled selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and stilettos and try to bag a man this aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women the acting for the most part was dull and humourless with the cast playing one dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note this is not entirely the actors fault had they spent more time developing the characters and the storyline adding a little injection of style and humour mvp might have been a hit what we re left with is something flat and vaguely unpleasant 
923,if you want your vision of chaplin limited to a lovable tramp and you get your belly laughs from pathos watch something else if however you love slapstick comedy as performed by one of the best do watch this one the image is of the tramp who really cannot get the girl he spots another couple kissing on a park bench and he has a blast ruining their fun this is one of chaplin s park comedies filmed in mack sennett s park with pickpockets and cops and couples these shorts work as the format allows chaplin to shine as he weaves through predicaments i checked the box as this could be considered a spoiler though it s not if you ve seen these films everyone ends up in the pond except chaplin he gets the girl who in this case was played by minta durfee a k a mrs roscoe fatty arbuckle 
801,according to the book the last of the cowboy heroes which is about joel mccrea audie murphy and randolph scott the author says that albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost hadn t been seen in years good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at paramount because a print was apparently found and now it s out on the open market albuquerque is a pretty good western too with scott involved in a family feud with uncle george cleveland george cleveland sends for his nephew randolph scott with the intention of making him part of his freighting business headquartered in the fast growing settlement of albuquerque cleveland is more than just a business owner he s the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair he even has the sheriff in his pocket randolph scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing that includes not backing relatives up when they re villains he goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister russell hayden and catherine craig cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western mata hari in the person of barbara britton to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals barbara s great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda randolph scott s original home studio was paramount it was where his first studio contract was with albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for paramount and they gave him a good one note also lon chaney jr who is george cleveland s chief henchman a rather loathsome bully of a man and gabby hayes who is just gabby hayes albuquerque must have been loved by republicans across the nation in 1948 with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair a certain democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone they had high hopes of winning the white house that year too but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in albuquerque i m not sure why cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot my guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to still albuquerque must have had great appeal to the gop market 
744,this is one of the best animated movies i ve ever seen in my life this isn t just a fun movie or a well made movie this is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren t just the technical skill that went into making it would grant it a place in the history of animation wladyslaw starewicz created a stop motion movie about the secret life of beetles he imagined a coherent world of insects with jobs houses nightclubs movie houses even little props like posters and bicycles and paintings in this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge mr beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly much to the chagrin of a grasshopper but he s a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling mr beetle returns home and finds mrs beetle having her own affair mr beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife the two make up and go out to the movies and the movie they watch is mr beetle and the dragonfly described thus it sounds banal but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema along with emile cohl and jiri trnka wladyslaw starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work for that reason he must not remain forgotten 
868,far from providing the caffeine kick you d expect from a film that shares its name with the most energy boosting of warm beverages coffy clunks about and never really rises above being just a ropey revenge tale indeed if the movie was a cup of coffee it d be rather weak and watery littered with a few undesirable dregs and lacking in a lingering aftertaste sporadically it hits the spot but otherwise it isn t the hot action drama it hopes to be plot wise coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drug pushing lady pimpin mob suckers that hooked her younger sister into a depraved sick state socio political commentary on the plight of urban black youths in america is prominent in coffy and it makes for some thought provoking stuff as coffy crusades against the political corruption and white establishment racism that profits and acts as a parasite off the targeted afro american minorities sadly the timely messages are undermined by the film s poor quality and lack of focus coffy s ideas are important it s just that they are not well aimed one of the plus points of coffy is the presence of blaxploitation icon pam grier grier goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she shotguns down the scum in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence how do you deal with a house full of hoods drive the car right through the front door it s just a shame that the storyline wavers on occasions wasting time squeezing as much sexual exploitation as possible the low budget can t have helped but neither does the fact that for a blaxploitation flick coffy lacks groove just as the issues are undermined by the lack of quality consequently the entertainment and excitement are also skewered by moments of dullness and misdirection the total result is workmanlike and wooden we get a hip heroine but not a hip movie it s a shame as coffy has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the blaxploitation craze it just never ascends above being an average lukewarm number 
62,while on vacation on northern australia gracie diana glenn her husband adam andy rodoreda and her younger sister lee maeve dermody decide to take the blackwater barry tour in the swamp for fishing their guide jim ben oxenbould uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot when they stop they are attacked by a huge crocodile that capsizes their boat and immediately kills jim the three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered location however in the muddy water their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water black water is a tense realistic and dramatic low budget movie and in accordance with the warning in the beginning based on a true event the acting of the unknown diana glenn maeve dermody and andy rodoreda is top notch giving credibility to this simple but scary story there are many similarities between this movie and prey but in different environments my vote is seven title brazil medo profundo deep fear 
502,this movie just seemed to lack direction the plot developed so many twists in such a short amount of time that it seemed to lose any semblance of what the true storyline was there was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering the exorcism scenes and possession story began to take a back seat to the character s back stories which were a little weak to begin with all in all i would say skip it unless you have rented out the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you haven t seen before you re much better off just watching the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose 
342,this is one of those star filled over the top comedies that could a be hysterical or b wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead unfortunately one night at mccool s is a classic b goldie hawn recently commented about town and country that it s a big problem in hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed you have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script they also mangled it daily maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say it s the script stupid this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through they re working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre is it an unmitigated disaster not entirely there are some smiles along the way mostly due to the efforts of the actors i probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking eh it was okay so why the undeniably hostile tone in my review the ending if as it s been noted the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending then it misses spectacularly i really wish i could speak specifically about it but i hate people who give too much away even in warning suffice it to say that as soon as you see john goodman behind a bent over paul reiser nothing given away here it s in the trailer get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking eh it was okay the rest of the movie is tacked on and creatively bankrupt and you ll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess if you loved there s something about mary or meet the parents both great movies then don t bother to see this movie go have those teeth taken care of instead 
401,the premise of this film is the only thing worthwhile it is very poorly made but the idea was clever if not entirely original it s a shame the other aspects of the film weren t better the acting is especially bad 
437,the green butchers anders thomas jensen denmark 2003 how do the danes keep coming up with these films that are consistently funny sharply written exquisitely filmed and filled with great performances the green butchers is a dark and wickedly funny comedy in many ways the danish counterpart of eating raoul and delicatessen but it has more on offer than just laughs or parody the film brings us the duo of chronic pothead bjarne nikolaj lie kaas and chronic perspirer svend mads mikkelsen sick of their evil boss the two pals decide to open their own butcher shop in a small danish town but initially business is slow and customers stay away when an electrician is accidentally locked up and freezes in their meat locker svend decides to turn the man s thigh into fillets he promptly nicknames chickie wickies this special dish suddenly has everyone in town flocking to their counter and svend unable to resist this sudden leap into popularity turns into a serial killer with bjarne acting as his reluctant accomplice but soon led by their ex boss many people in town are starting to wonder what special ingredients the two men are using without the extraordinary performances by kaas and mikkelsen the film might not have risen above the level of the average black comedy on paper the character of svend might border on caricature but mads mikkelsen portrait is that of an earnest insecure and deeply twisted man but mikkelsen manages to make him frightening funny and moving at the same time kaas actually plays a double role also playing his comatose twin brother eigil when watching the film i never even realized it was the same actor the other performances are just as wonderful with every character in town refreshingly off the hook with some truly wonderful vignettes the subject material is naturally a bit morbid and the material might not be completely fresh considering quite a few predecessors that handled the same kind of material but director jensen gives it a fresh twist and manages to build some real characters with the strange duo of svend and bjarne with this wonderfully bizarre tale of two social misfits camera obscura 9 10
883,i saw this movie when it aired on the wb and fell in love with riley smith immediately i would recommend the movie to people of all ages who just feel like being entertained and not much more i wish they d air it again or cast riley smith in another movie

you don t mean to say that yours is a school for boys and girls he asks one of the early girls only girls she says cheerfully does this mean sir asks one of nutbourne s teachers that we are to expect 100 young girls it means that not only have the ministry made a mistake in sending a school here at all but that it is guilty of an appalling sexual aberration margaret rutherford s miss whitchurch as positive and immovable as a battleship intends to make the best of it by briskly taking over nutbourne if possible alastair sim s pond is exasperated up to his big bald head and is determined to salvage his school in the meantime there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep along with all their teachers the cooks and caretakers totally put upon walk out miss whitchurch and her girls however are up to the cooking tasks come now angela she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big pot haven t you made porridge before yes but no one ever had to eat it that s a defeatist attitude my dear stir it well and don t shilly shally things are hardly going well when pond discovers four governors from a school he hopes to lead are arriving at any moment to see for themselves how well led nutbourne is and miss whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new boy free they were told facilities the only solution miss whitchurch and pond their teachers and their students concoct a split second shifting of classes to give the allusion that nutbourne has no girls and that st swithen s has no boys after the parents inspect a dorm and leave for a class the girls in the beds duck under and the boys who d been hidden under leap up into the beds just as the governors walk in the boys are observed at rugby and as soon as the governors turn their backs the goal posts are taken down nets for lacrosse are put up and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls one parent spots her daughter in a science class then moments later sees her in a choir practice then moments later there s angela again she says to miss whitchurch why so it is she replies hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner the child s quite ubiquitous when we leave nutbourne everything has been discovered the students are milling about the teachers are dazed except for two who are kissing the education ministry has just sent several more busloads of students the parents are speechless but the governors are not we re waiting for an explanation one says sharply pond holds his head and shudders can t you see i m trying to think of one the film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by rutherford and sim sim s droll exasperation and rutherford s implacable determination are so well matched that s it s a shame this is the only movie they ever made together joyce grenfell as gossage st swithen s tall awkward loping sports teacher gives them some competition if you keep your eyes open you ll also find some amusing references director frank launder works in including a gong at nutbourne that looks just like a midget version of j arthur rank s a faint echo of the zither theme from the third man and a shot stolen from david lean s oliver twist except this time the little boy walks up holding his porridge bowl and says please sir i don t want anymore frank launder and his partner sidney gilliat were responsible for some of the best films produced in britain during the thirties forties and fifties they wrote produced and directed sometimes doing one sometimes the other in one way or another they were responsible for such first rate films as green for danger with a masterly droll performance by sim i see a dark stranger the lady vanishes night train to munich wee geordie the belles of st trinian s the rake s progress and many others with the happiest days of your life launder wrote and directed while both produced it s one of their best 
8,i married a japanese woman 14 years ago we re still together however in the 1950 s it would never have been as easy life in the military had been mined for action drama and comedy for years by this point mined to death the mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover this is old hat today but then marrying an asian back then meant you either owed somebody something or you were a freak of some sort this touched on both possibilities along with the third maybe it is love brando did his usual good job garner did a better job than he usually does he s good but this showed how good he could be umecki chan had a helluva debut here and while i think she earned her statue she didn t really stretch it was a role that no one who hadn t been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corker the real scene stealer was red buttons red was the best thing in this film bank on it and the japanese lifestyles were shown in an admirable light as well a classic 
428,this is a very bad movie however i read that it was made by a high school teacher so maybe i should give it at least a tiny bit of praise for it s ambitious yet awful special effects here is the plot a monster emerges from a pile of trash and pollution in the town of milpitas california and embarks on a destructive rampage i m about to spoil the big surprise about what the monster looks like so please read the rest of this at your own risk you have been warned the monster looks sort of like a giant two legged fly wearing a gas mask in some scenes the monster is an actor wearing a costume in other scenes the monster is created by stop motion animation the acting is terrible the dialogue is terrible the special effects are terrible the plot is predictable stay away 
210,what can i say ms erika eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever and like a italian american fan number one of female beauty i can t forget this movie you know i really don t remember a lot about the plot or the situations or the other actors i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous erika and that in this film she looks better than ever i really don t care if it was a bad movie or a good movie i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in brooklyn just contemplating erika s beauty well just to conclude if you are an erika eleniak s beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you 
288,well ok i watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now i pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and i must say i actually think this movie is good this movie caught a buzz as the bootleg i know what you did last summer 3 much like final stab was to scream 4 and well this movie isn t that bad i mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick this movie is not half bad it has some scares and some really hot women i might add plus it shows off joey lawrence s new beefy look though obviously even that hasn t won him any big hollywood roles either i feel bad for the man he had such a career in the early and mid 90 s with blossom some disney movies and the everlasting lawrence brothers show joey lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene but then like in a 360 degree turn his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one the movie also throws you off guard in it makes you think between the crew there really is a secret that someone knows to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret it also throws you off on who the killer is i had an idea but still woulnd t think the killer was who he was but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown now had there been a secret that was let out this movie could ve been one of the better b rated movies but also i am a sucker for college themes and i also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie a so so slasher flick good for a midnight movie 
767,my sincere advice to all don t watch the movie don t even go near to the theater where this movie is being played even a glimpse of it is bad for health serious no jokes it s 3 30 am in the morning and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe four hours damn i am proud that i survived after all of it if this is called survival i am highly frustrated annoyed disappointed it was sheer waste of time money went in drain no plot hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night rubbish movie happy republic day to one and all :)
289,this film had a distinct woody allen feel about it so if you re not a fan of dry humor dark humor or back handed humor you probably could find something else to do if you are however this is quirky with some nice twists and a flowing natural dialog the story itself is quite engaging not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot disengage your eyes but close i mean that in the best way possible the intrigues are plenty the twists are enough to fully engage the senses and the characters are downright lovable i had a great time with this movie it rates an 8 3 10 from the fiend 
630,this is an astonishing film a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs everything in it is beautifully filmed the women the apartments but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images almost every scene has echoes of another this is a story told in light in colour in many almost parallels every time i watch it it fills me with delight the acting is great too romane bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown everything about her changes with her mood vincent cassel plays a very different role to his part in la haine but no less excellently shifty and sympathetic at the same time and monica bellucci ah monica bellucci well put simply she plays is the world s most perfect woman there s one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile yet in that instant says more than hours of hollywood junk one cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb sequential climax sad shocking ironic and subtle in turn but if one moment captures the brilliance of this work it s the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story yet when the moment comes it is handled so delicately so briefly so deftly that on reflection it makes you gasp only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underplay this vital point but the confidence is justified cinema doesn t come much better than this 
688,i saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends its reputation had preceded it and though all my friends were also of legal age i alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it we gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend though we sat in close proximity to each other we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other s presence as it turned out the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt it did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content but it disappointed in every other way caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick it fails miserably in its ambition subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds the film s obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real graphic sex but in setting this sex in the context of caligula s depraved reign it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of caligula in it sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination in the present day it is somewhat common to hear words like sin and depravity used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it the historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex they fail to entertain enlighten intrigue or interest the viewer in any way they only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium rarely has a film proved so boring the sex after the initial shock and astonishment fades only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence while many films more violent than caligula have been made few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence apparenly unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper depraved sexuality characterized caligula s emperorship the violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex a review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells i understand why someone would want to see this film after all i myself succumbed to the same curiosity i simply hope that my review by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not my high school criminal justice teacher described police work as hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror this statement perfectly describes caligula you have been warned 
844,what an ambitious project kenneth branagh undertook here and how well it was realized this is the first filmed version of hamlet to use the full text of shakespeare s play but branagh didn t do it just because it was there his intention i believe was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down so to speak in return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves a fair enough proposition and one that s a bargain the setting is a generic 19th century european one and this does more than work well it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself the production design and cinematography and both outstanding which helps immensely when you re watching a four hour movie branagh s casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise the direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play since so much of hamlet is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels battles etc this can be a daunting task but everything branagh tries to do seems to work branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor writer directors if not always the best since he made his big splash with henry v one quibble i had with him was what i saw as a tendency to ham it up at times in his portrayal of hamlet here he might be accused of that again but there is a method at work let s face it hamlet is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before he or she needs help even if they ve read the play hamlet has the most lines of any shakespearian character and branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film even if you don t know the literal meaning of every arcane word this performance by branagh was at the very least worthy of an oscar nomination there are so many other outstanding performances here they re almost too numerous to mention but some of them must be acknowledged derek jacobi as claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to kate winslet when it comes to handing out praise her portrayal of ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time she looks to me like the finest young actress around other super performers in no particular order are richard briers nicholas farrell michael maloney and reece dinsdale and timothy spall as guildenstern and rosencrantz respectively honorable mention goes to julie christie charlton heston and robin williams who manages to do his thing here successfully even billy crystal as a gravedigger works the one cast member who doesn t inexplicably is jack lemmon in the very opening scene he appears and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor you know this must have been a real dilemma for branagh since everything else about the movies screams out that it s the work of a perfectionist not to be facetious when speaking of a four hour movie but it does seem just a tad too long some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit if i may be so bold and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome did i forget anything other than patrick doyle s score no doubt i did i ll just sum up by saying that kenneth branagh may have made the definitive film version of hamlet and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one
