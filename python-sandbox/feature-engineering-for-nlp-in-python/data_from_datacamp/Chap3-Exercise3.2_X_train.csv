575,okay so i m not a big video game buff but was the game house of the dead really famous enough to make a movie from sure they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie as though justifying any particular scene of violence but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same with the hand in the bottom on the screen supposedly your own holding whatever weapon and goo ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be it s an interesting premise in house of the dead with a lot of college kids loaded college kids as it were kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like 1 500 just for a ride after they miss their boat trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year the first thing that comes to mind about house of the dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations at least in this case the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed they look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter tops but at least they thought they were dressed for the occasion clint howard tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far delivers an absolutely awful performance the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie i can t stand it when well known actors change their accents in movies it is so rarely effective and howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well known actor pretend that he s this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air he didn t even rasp well it sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something real tough there clint i expected more from him but then again he did agree to a part in this mess once we get to the island the movie temporarily turns into any one of the friday the 13th movies that took place at camp crystal lake lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed the nudity was impressive i guess but let s consider something for a minute these kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the rave of the year find no one and say well who wants a beer even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn t think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight here you have the input from director uwe boll there s alcohol they won t notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves so not only do they start drinking not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they re alone it s like they expected to find the island empty and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while they would have some privacy since there s no one else around brilliant now for the things that everyone hated judging by the reviews that i ve read about the movie yes intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie mostly in order to show that yes the movie was being faithful to directly copying the video game sure it was a stupid idea i can t imagine who thought up that little nugget but worse than that is the matrix style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over after the first time at which point i found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film one of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans who are much faster but getting tired running out of places to run and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with the first two are done right in the movie the kids are terrified and don t have a lot of places to run since they re on an island but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler they find themselves heavily armed and i mean that very strongly i mean these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead then you have what i call the techno slasher scene since the rave never happened and i guess since uwe boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie there s one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video there s techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it s nothing but a blur of gory shot mostly only about 5 frames long which is about 1 6 of a second flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music clever i guess but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross out effect because you can t see any one thing for long enough to react to it you re just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie i ve seen a lot of people compare this movie to resident evil mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it and they re exactly right i appreciate that at least here as was not the case in resident evil it wasn t some man made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires 28 days later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie it s just too bad that house of the dead didn t do a single original thing except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based just in case you forget i really think that this should have been a much better movie while obviously i can t say that i know much about the game it s based on just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie but unfortunately i think that s more often the case than not with horror movies it s really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no holds barred horror film and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot which suggests the possibility of a sequel 
964, and if you re very very good it will resemble moon over parador this film had a slightly silly story but it was a fantasy after all and the casting and the acting was spot on dreyfuss was perfect as the actor impostor full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have you get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes this was one of dreyfuss s best roles just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator and the parting scene like something out of casablanca indeed raul julia was superb as the paradorian chief of secret police he gets some really funny lines some of which are homages to other films like round up the usual suspects and sonia braga was excellent as the girl friend in addition to being a really hot number you should get an oscar for tonight let us not forget johnny winters as the cia agent and the several guest stars playing themselves sammy davis jr ike pappas dick cavett all perfectly done all in all a memorable romp under the paradorian moon r 
446,the more i analyze this film the worse it becomes first of all why a motivational speaker that part was just stupid i mean why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker is alexander stone really that disorganized first he can t decide what he wants to do to control the world so he looks to the bible for ideas many of these ideas i might add really have no reliability for example the part of the the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror could have already happened it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something and gillen lane s family they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water i might add that since casper van dien gillen lane is only in his twenties or that s the impression that i had and has a ten year child he had his child during high school yeah there goes tbn s family values also why did this film have to be so damn propaganda like i ll repeat what an earlier reviewer said the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated this film doesn t do that the beginnig starts off well with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy s omega code then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of the two prophets tell him tell your master that we are here dominic ironsides replies he already knows and points to a small surveillance camera that part sent chills up my spine had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film i ll give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character as does michael ironsides but the good guys are horrible i ve already went on about lane s family now that i m over the acting i ll get on to plot this is obviously a baptist film since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well done also another diatribe against the vatican their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded since gillen explains to the pope that it s not the end of the world but the beginning of a new one also the vatican or israelis says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world whoever it was they wouldn t just secede they d send over commandoes and kill them this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying we re not going to talk to you any more come on i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor mediocre in short 
54,good animation nice character design and a light hearted story make suzumiya haruhi no yuutsu enjoyable to watch after my first viewing i thought that this anime was pretty good but but was much better on for a second watch this is because it is done out of chronological order and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connections you didn t see before or it may be that you see a second meaning to some events you didn t notice before you may want to read the original novels not manga by tanigawa nagaru before after seeing this the anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows however there are some short stories from the book that are not animated but are referenced to bamboo w wishes attached shown in episode 14 overall this anime is actually very good once after brief analyzation of the plot reading the book improves upon it as well it is a nice break from the shounen jump anime that seem to be taking over 
33,as with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is overpopulation means there s too many people to feed i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies stalin s policy in the soviet union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was mao s rural policy in china which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s and let s not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth hong kong and macau have never suffered a famine in modern times likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn t strictly down to overpopulation it s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside it s a symptom of industrial progress not of too many births so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughablebut don t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of the70s it plays on the contempary audience s knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit brandy and fresh meat thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line if i could afford it i d smoke two maybe three of these a day but it s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that s memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals flowers running water and snow covered mountains a world thorn s generation has never known this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth
683,i have seen this movie twice now on cable the first time i saw it it caught me by suprise the skaters i was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of skateboarder magazine back in the late 70 s these were the guys we copied and tried to become while skating i am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be i am almost 40 years old now and i guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life s problems however this film did a great job of taking me back back to the vacant pools the backyard halfpipes and the road trips to cherry hill nj i suspect that in order to really understand this movie and appreciate it you had to live it otherwise it probably won t have the impact on you as it did me but for those of you and you know who you are who did live it you know exactly what i am talking about in any event i don t care who you are if you get a chance to see this movie do it i give thanks to the z boys of dogtown for the memories of my youth and thanks to stacy for making this movie job well done 
685,when i first saw this show i was 9 and it caught my attention right away when stewie was trying to call lois on the phone in the hotel i laughed and kept on watching when the episode was finished i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly this separates itself from the simpsons and other shows on say cartoon network because the jokes are more mature not too much but it s tv 14 for a reason the quick film cuts after each punch line and cute funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special talented seth macfarlene is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show a good theme song and a crazy family that there s always something funny makes this my favorite cartoon along sealab 2021 and aqua teen hunger force check it out it s funny stuff 
95,this movie is excellent not because it does anything special or new but because it is consistently great in all of its parts no part stands out as being ground breaking or stellar but all parts are far above mediocre and that makes to me an excellent movie i own several copies of this movie and may acquire it on collectors dvd or blu ray someday holding off right now due to high blu ray prices and of course the face that i don t have a blu ray player but that s beside the point of this review it stars off sort of ordinary but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension some action strongly portrayed characters and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very end wait no it does not start out ordinary it starts out sort of like what a qun tar movie wishes it could be with an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes very very wrong by the end of the movie nothing was as it seemed and a few people are dead and a few people are very rich i won t tell you who watch and enjoy overall rating 10 10 a excellent 
625,so i turned on the tv today at 1 00 pm on a sunday expecting to see crap and infomercials and this great movie was just starting didn t know what it was but drew me in almost immediately the movie was excellent there were a couple of things that didn t make sense for one i don t get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation but then jimmy doesn t really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation in other words it wasn t his initiative that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck second i don t get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end because the whole thing was partly casued by the thief people stealing panda s money and then the other thief kills panda at the end so they steal his money twice and kill him how is that good 
407,yes i know that this movie is meant as a comedy and the humor is over the top but the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched i cannot say that it will happen but if we don t take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility i have noticed that some schools aren t teaching facts anymore like history geography basic stuff the focus is more on learning practical abilities the theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work in the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with gatorade in stead of water well we can laugh about it but if you never been taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow so how would you know to me this is a scary notion so now you understand why this subject isn t funny anymore it could be that mike judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesn t improve fast am i taking this movie too seriously yes of course to each his own fun i loved mike judge s work beavis and butthead and office space in these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time in idiocracy i missed this most of the events are too absurd and as i said earlier very scary i do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie 
917, the running jumping standing still film is not a film as such but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme this film got richard lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first beatles film a hard day s night richard lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959 this film was entitled the running jumping standing still film it was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production since the film was intended to be viewed by lester and his partners alone a small amount of money and time was invested the sole purpose of this film is entertainment but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera the film cost 70 to make and it was filmed in sepia toned film stock in a field on a couple of sundays all of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production the finished production is eleven minutes in length the running jumping standing still film is a comedy about english sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time all of the events in this film take place in a field a few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record a photographer developing film in a pond an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model s face a man building a tent an athlete running over the tent and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away but it also pokes fun at english culture when compared to american culture another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite which has been constructed out of the flag of the united kingdom one of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it and the kite breaks according to neil sinyard author of the films of richard lester this event symbolizes the united kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the united states during the space age according to this scene the british fly primitive kites while the americans the world power after world war ii fly highly advanced rockets and space shuttles 
247,this series is vastly underrated like many others i came upon farscape after the series had been cancelled bought season 1 and was surprised to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense romance wit and of course sci fi right off the bat it got a 10 for being the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero and every alien with whom he comes in contact speaks english okay a few others have skirted the issue but farscape did it the best the point is the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible with so much bad programming out there it s a shame that balanced entertaining series such as farscape don t get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production while we enjoy the four seasons and thankfully the four hour miniseries maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show 
779,the saddest thing about this tribute is that almost all the singers including the otherwise incredibly talented nick cave seem to have missed the whole point where cohen s intensity lies by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry his irony his all round humanity laughter and tears in one to see some of these singer upstarts make convoluted suffering faces launch their pathetic squeals in the patent effort to scream i m a singer is a true pain it s the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as lennon s imagine nothing simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original if there is a form of art that doesn t need embellishments it s cohen s art embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless make up of sex for sale in this cohen s tribute i found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and if truth be told several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show it s cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material really not the other way around they may have been friends or his daughter s he could have become very tender hearted and in the mood for a gift too bad it didn t stay in the family fortunately but only at the very end cohen himself performed his majestic tower of song but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the u2 all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing home a sad show really and sadder if you truly love cohen as i do 
875,my mother told me not to go to see kadosh but who ever listens to one s mother i was so turned off by it while i was watching i thought i must have lost my feminist credentials on the way into the theater so i checked with card carrying feminists the next day no they also thought it was much more an anti orthodox screed than a pro feminist statement painting the orthodox as equal to the taliban while this israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the story is about is the ultimate ultra orthodox messianists it is so nasty as to be unbelievable plus that the non fanatic orthodox rock n roller one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexy even in israel that must be fantasy the theater was quite crowded so there s a pent up curiosity to see israeli movies too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution this was almost enough to drive me back to insipid hollywood romantic movies originally written 4 29 2000 
453,mature intelligent and highly charged melodrama unbelivebly filmed in china in 1948 wei wei s stunning performance as the catylast in a love triangle is simply stunning if you have the oppurunity to see this magnificent film take it
720,i may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity i turned the channel the original series only lasted 2 years which can be said about the careers for adam west and burt ward put these two actors in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad 
34,on the scale of 1 to 10 i gave this a 4 i thought the film was not very good with too much violence and not one character to like on an erotic scale i give this a 6 many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness i always enjoy nudity and nancy travis and faye grant come through but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic 
557,this is a very dull film with poorly developed characters subplots that go nowhere and barely tolerable acting it comes across as a poorly conceived rip off of 2001 the only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects but even that wasn t enough to keep me from nodding off i would like to get the soundtrack especially the music during the space flight sequence for nights when i have trouble falling asleep 
733,i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance i really hope norton did not do this he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie i found it entertaining it wasn t mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects but it was not a bad it was fun to watch but yea definitely not a bad horrible movie 7 10
916,this obvious pilot for an unproduced tv series features young canadian actress shiri appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man turned flying demon is let loose on the world the cgi is par for a tv job and appleby is ok as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine familiar tv face richard burgi is along for the ride as appleby s mentor but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level we see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start a bad sign also the scenes where burgi is training appleby for battle are actually laughable they are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies most notably remo williams 
821,the second in the vacation series is easily the least enjoyable one as clark griswold wins a trip for the whole family to europe the tasteless below the belt humor that worked so well the first time around is practically nonexistent here that fault surely lies with director hackerling who s obviously nowhere near as good a director as harold ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around the cast does what they can chevy chase injects some form of life into the proceedings but it s simply not enough and the very funny eric idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky englishman some potentially hilarious moments aren t played out to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated all depictions of europeans are one dimensional and almost universally not funny at all like how the english are sooo polite apart from a few scenes there s hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick but if you re a chevy chase fan like myself the film is watchable but no more than that 
308,ll cool j morgan freeman dylan mcdermott kevin spacey john heard cary elwes roslyn sanchez justin timberlake wait a minute justin timberlake and he s the star i should have known better than to rent edison force in fact i did know better but in a moment of absolute weakness i rented this stv when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv you know it s one of two things an indie or a dog as in sat on a shelf which this did and with good reason the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force and journalist timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them he is targeted for his efforts or maybe i should say for his horrible acting i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing just awful the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard looking like nothing so much as a hobo you just know the director was not in control freeman is clearly slumming 
81,at first i was convinced that this was a made for tv movie that wasn t worthy of primetime but after a few minutes of dumb struck awe i realized that there was at least comic value in the over the top stunts and c movie acting this movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and i hadn t laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face it was like a less funny spy version of the big hit i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd with even worse acting we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena and not jim after all of the hugging and high fives a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier 
677,the first home alone was a decent enough film the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting this one tries to be original and succeeds to some degree of course the formula is basically the same so it s like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot the new score is quite bad though the new setting traps piece was if nothing else interesting and different especially compared to the grand score of the first and the almost but not quite as good score of the second it almost makes up for it by using some pretty good non original music but it s just not the same the plot is fair and somewhat original to the franchise but it s still basically the same movie as the first two with worse acting and a less impressive example of the scary character turning out to be good the acting is mostly unimpressive the characters are mostly caricatures the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones and they make fun of spy stuff which is almost criminal given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are and how precious few of them are cool the fact that there are more of them and thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films and it doesn t work the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too adult and serious for a children s film and there was a sexual joke or two though that isn t the first time in the series it s also unnecessarily complex as is the plot in general i could follow it but i doubt a kid could some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid the animal stuff is generally not amusing there are fewer siblings which should mean that those there are get developed more but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films all in all just not particularly good or worth watching unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon y violence i recommend this to huge fans of the series only 3 10
960,i m still laughing not i m still asking my myself what the point was i barely got a chuckle this movie sucks it tries to be charming and touching but it turns out stupid i do not recommend it 
262,this is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention it s not going to win any oscars it s really not a very good movie at all heck it s not even really a movie just a string of short disgusting gross out skits strung together in an effort to make entertainment and as much as every critical bone in my body cries out to give this movie a failing score gosh darn it i m going to give it a much better score the kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say so i m not going to give some snobby critique of jackass s quality of surreal existentialism that permeates and commentates on how our society oh forget it what s to say there s no plot development no character development no real beginning there s a semi enjoyable end that s not nearly as funny as the skit that precedes it and everything in between reeks of improper bathroom humor that junior high kids laugh at it s actually pretty funny leave at the door all your preconceptions of a good movie jackass number two is just gross out crap that s really all it is i do give the filmmakers this though they come up with some pretty imaginative stuff you ll probably cringe several times throughout want to throw up a couple times wiggle and shift uncomfortably as the people on screen do death and vomit defying stunts vomit crap urine semen virtually every bodily fluid can be seen in jackass number two there s nudity sexual humor abounds and so on and so forth it s entertaining if you re the kind of person who finds this stuff enjoyable then you will probably really like jackass number two i laughed several times like i said it s pretty imaginative stuff i never once wanted to vomit though i do have a pretty strong stomach just accept the movie s premise a bunch of idiotic guys do weird crap for fun once you get past that accepting it and going with it you ll enjoy it the only flaw in the movie is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting stuff there are several very imaginative very disturbing skits but it drags in many places as they do ones that are less interesting towards the end things pick up but in the middle of the movie the drag hurts the overall film s quality in a half hour tv show this isn t a problem but with film length celluloid it s inevitable that boredom will ensue at some point after awhile the gross crap just becomes desensitizing on the whole though number two is an entertaining imaginative and above all disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain nausea and hilarity go see it if you must but hey if you know you don t like this kind of stuff don t bother you ll just be disappointed 
332,i was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of l anglaise in this beautifully acted intellectually and visually compelling film thank you so much monsieur le directeur rohmer 
391,after having watched darwin s nightmare one must have the impression of tanzania being a living hell with its population being quasi slaves delivering the finest fish to the well fed europeans while leaving the fish bones to the starving population in exchange for the fish they get western made weapons which the mainly unemployed population eagerly awaits to use because being a soldier is their only source of income so everything is all dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and source of all misery not quite fortunately darwin s nightmare shows the dark sides only and completely spares the positive aspects in fact the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecologic importance the victoriaperch has for the region for the countries around lake victoria the victoriaperch is the second to third most important source of income the wages in the fishing industry are way above average tanzania has banned huge trawlers to secure the jobs of thousands of fishermen the adjacent states have met agreements to keep fishing on a sustainable level cities at the lake are benefiting from the taxes the fishers have to pay for each kilogram caught fish and the taxes on the factories exports and profits furthermore tanzania has banned exporting the local traditional fish which still play an important role feeding the local population by ignoring those positive signs the documentary deters the badly needed western consumers and investors and thus threatens to aggravate the african s situation for further reading i can recommend two articles the german alternative wing newspaper wrote on the subject http www taz de pt 2006 09 02 a0013 1 textdruck http www taz de pt 2005 03 17 a0151 1 text
841,i like both this version of dorian gray and the mgm version both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have an association with dorian this is not in the original book and that is my only complaint i especially like angela lansbury as sybil vane and george sanders as harry in the mgm version but shane briant as dorian in the tv version is much better looking i think and far more ruthless than hurd hatfield in the mgm version i think briant is more true to the novel s dorian in the end this is a very good adaptation of the novel it even hints at dorian s liaison s with men as does wylde which could not be done in the mgm version 
142,not sure if this is just a lousy movie or if it was intended to be a mockery of a b western story line was so so but the filming editing and acting were just plain bad plus the music in the background was irritating to no end too loud and just non stop many times you could not make out the dialog over the background music i m in sass single action shooting society and do some old west shooting with them and a lot of the actors are members of this group so that s why i bought it if you have no interest in this group of people or that sport you certainly most likely wouldn t even have this little bit of interest to help out with the film the acting of even the veteran actors particularly stella stevens left a lot to be desired also 
166,i should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art because they are human beings and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature that said the simplistic notion that ingmar bergman s great 1968 film shame or skammen is merely an anti war film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film compared to its more filmically showoffy predecessors persona and hour of the wolf shame is seemingly a more classic film in terms of narrative but the key word is seemingly for while it lacks the bravura pop psychologizing of persona and the gaudy horror film homages of hour of the wolf it is one of the best films ever made about war and not as an anti war film nor a pro war film as such it has to rank with wild strawberries as one of his greatest films as well as one of his best screenplays if not the best although ostensibly a more psychologically exterior film than the films that preceded it it truly says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive in it max von sydow and liv ullman play jan and eva rosenberg perhaps a nod at the infamous american spies whom many european intellectuals felt were innocent two musicians who used to play for the local philharmonic orchestra before a war broke out and they retreated to live on a small plot of land on an island content to working in a greenhouse the country they live in is unnamed as is the island they live on although the film was made on bergman s small island of farö just off the northern end of the swedish island of göttland it seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another province this is all left deliberately hazy as this war is meant to symbolize all wars this is reinforced as the film starts with assorted war quotes on the screen as the credits roll these include quotes from hitler to vietnam era american military figures after early scenes that depict the prosaic nature of their rural life and then the coming of war where even old men are conscripted an aerial attack ravages the rosenbergs land as enemy jets fly overhead dropping bombs and what seems to be chemical weapons of an agent orange like nature one plane is hit and a parachutist jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree jan who starts off the film as a sniveling coward refuses to go and help so eva goes alone jan joins her and they find the pilot has been shot it seems he is indeed part of the invading or possibly rebel force a bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot then advise the couple to leave their home as the invaders are near there are the misinterpretations of the film on a micro level such as that of bergman scholar marc gervais who provides the film commentary on the dvd of the film like many other critics he claims that jacobi is a quisling who has collaborated with the invaders but this is clearly and demonstrably wrong for jacobi is with the original fascist government as proof first off the invaders are repelled after they invade the rosenbergs land and shoot their agitprop interview we know this because the government that later questions them of the faked interview and words put into eva s mouth see the film as supposed proof of their treason and jacobi is clearly working with them the fascist big brother statists secondly jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the townsfolk are sent to concentration camps for collaborating with the invaders and the rosenbergs again are among those spared thirdly in his seduction of eva jacobi tells her his son is on leave from the military and clearly if he was an invader he would not be speaking so happily of his son serving the state also rebel forces are not official armies and do not grant official leave lastly filip is clearly with the rebels or invaders of the organization and why would he have killed a colleague that gervais and other critics so blatantly and wantonly misinterpret and flat out miss such a key and manifest point of this film brings into question their ability to discern any and all aspects of all of bergman s films this is a wonderful and great film and very high in the berman canon but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers have really understand its complex message instead opting out for the cheap lazy and easy claim of its being merely anti war and a rather simple film in comparison to its two showier predecessors and that in the long run is the real shame of shame 
713,i think it is a brilliant show with cool talking heads and very cool action 2 guys who pretend to be masters in women seduction demonstrate their skills at different night clubs and 4 experts pickup artists themselves comment on them choosing the winner their jokes are amusing and some participators are really fun to watch more so this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women lots of expert s comments are useful while you may see how it works in the field actually i think this is one of the best tv shows and i totally recommend this to all men who like women ps pardon for my broken engrish 
50,human pot roast joe don baker mitchell stars in this dull unremarkable action movie as deputy geronimo a fat gassy slob who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit listening to country music and eating too many donuts meanwhile a vaguely criminal guy named palermo played by the guy who owned the drill in fulci s gates of hell stumbles into joe don s territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene joe don slowly gives chase and offs palermo s brother after uttering his now legendary catch phrase it s your move think you can take me well go ahead on for some reason joe don a texas lawman must transport palermo to italy mr palermo s been a major source of embarrassment to the italian government says mr wilson another vague character played by bill mckinney who was in master ninja 1 she freak and a lot of good clint eastwood movies anyhoo joe don s plane must land on the island of malta where palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like jon lovitz and that s where the movie grinds to a halt for the rest of the movie joe don looks for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more then joe don keeps looking for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more then joe don looks for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more this is one aggravating movie at one point joe don is thought to be dead at sea all the other characters wonder if he s dead or not finally concluding that he is but then he shows up he was rescued by a poor family and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days even his cute julia louise dreyfuss esque sidekick doesn t welcome him back she does however offer to help him find palermo so joe don looks for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more highpoints include a bizarre carnival with strange colorful floats some sexy strippers a shoot out involving a kid dressed like napoleon and a cart of tomatoes a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk and any scene without joe don lowpoints include joe don threatening a stripper with a coat hanger it should be noted that this is from greydon clark director of angel s revenge who appears as the sheriff ick 
224,this movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain it might be enjoyed by anybody who thinks that it would be funny to see his her mother in a crowded discotheque full of people half her age inventing some totally ridiculous dance in a completely misguided effort to be hip in the parlance of that age to see ingrid bergman stoop to such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor was hard to watch i was embarrassed to make matters worse the music in the disco was not realistic at all it is the bogus idea of some hollywood director about what pop music was like at the time that is always a total embarrassment in most films of that era the ersatz music is canned and bears only a painful passing resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the 60 s mathau is hopelessly miscast as some kind of ladies man he just looks lecherously grotesque hawn s wide eyed innocence is just too silly the handsome neighbor in her apartment is portrayed way too earnestly and seriously he seems like a brady kid who got lost in this farce painful pitiful mess 
45,i was one of the few non liberals who showed up to see steve s video it was quite an experience in propaganda film making and boredom i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moore s visit to my local school uvsc but it turned out to be another liberal slash and burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community it sure seems self serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues what s more surprising is to see all the 10 votes his homeys have posted here did they even see the video golly gee batman this must rank with all the president s men their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film yeah like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie maybe my vote will help balance this out 
104,first of all this was not a three hour movie two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials aren t actually part of a movie perhaps though it should ve been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but i m not so sure that s a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didn t need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sad anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints the actress who played viv vance not great casting at all and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she s a whole new person that wasn t too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy desi no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn t necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy desi had there been more time had the story been more about lucy s entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more but they weren t so we got to see the likes of gable lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucy s life really neat and it s too bad that wasn t explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i don t think i ll ever watch this again and i don t think this movie ll be that memorable for someone who digs i love lucy but isn t an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b
479,trite clichéd dialog and plotting the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies hokey music and a paint by numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans what saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of bakshi s work the rotoscoping and the fact that frank frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him this is frazetta in motion the violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword sorcery movie of the period i like to watch this with the sound off playing the soundtrack to the first conan movie instead 
516,after a quasi gothic all fruity music video the movie starts with cassidy the lead singer killing herself in a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll we don t live n that world the insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence when i say clown i mean actual clown he tell them they re all going to die via cassidy s ghost the spirit possesses dora one of the band mates we couldn t care less as the characters are all boring vapid and extremely horribly acted written by adam hackbarth an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one and directed by corbin timbrook who after the attendant and tower of blood has to know that he keeps making crap for a living this movie s a constant battle between the film s incompetence and the viewer s need to stay awake not enough blood to appease gore hounds nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone my grade f eye candy amanda carraway gets topless where i saw it starz on demand
120,the comments of the previous user are harsh indeed one wonders if they have even seen this beautiful sweet film as for being so nasty about it in front of the writer director well thats just plain rude for those who grew up in the eighties it is an artful piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well acted and produced irish film making sure has a lot of bitter angry people involved with it and the spleen venting comment made about this is evidence of it as people we have a choice give out and moan about the people who actually go out there and make stuff or make something yourself i know which one is easier do yourself a favour and watch this film and see how a short film is made you won t be disappointed
346,although i was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school 1996 when i saw it i became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them their hair clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar i remember thinking how real it was and how i wished that they would make movies like that still in fact i saw this movie the night after i had been at a crazy party not so unlike the one in jay s house which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd a world class bs er and responsible mother figure type i identified immediately with jeanie i was also the one with a car although i had a little bit of madge s insecurities floating around in there too my best friend was a deidre and her good friend from childhood was our annie watching the scene when jeanie is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations i had personally had now at the age of 27 i recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth though none of my friends died i think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up 
132,this movie wasn t too funny it wasn t too horrible either just a fun ride aboard the soul plane it s a black owned flight service with a kick ass disco beautiful bar and pumping stewards the plot takes you through the whole idea of a black not race or color but style owned plane with the same style of black humor at times there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the normal lavatory in the normal plane check that out there are lulls however and i find it most in the character who played the soul pilot watch to find out who it is all in all it s a fun movie tom arnold adds to the fun with his cracker attitude this is one movie to watch when playing poker when you re drunk or just vegging 
812,this movie was included in the six wives of henry viii bbc miniseries dvd i loved those six movies they were well acted well scripted and historically accurate i did actually read gregory s book and liked it well enough despite it s huge historical inaccuracies i mean the whole fake homosexual angle with george boleyn in particular but this movie didn t even mention that that angle was one of the pivotal points of the book above all this movie just leaves me asking why why do we see as someone else aptly put the real world tudor england why are the camera angles so bad in general why is the script so bad i mean i know it was improv but come on the actors at time stutter and stammer over their lines and it s obvious that they re making them up as they go along why are the sex scenes so awkward the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting in the movie they re just bad verging on being absolutely hilarious at one point the actress playing mary boleyn was having sex with the actor playing henry viii he s thrusting away and she s got this look on her face that says hm i need to go to the store is he done yet maybe if he finishes i can go pick up some cheese real quick it s just bad why does catherine of aragon play such a small role in this movie her refusal to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that rocked christiandom she s the reason why henry viii and anne boleyn couldn t get immediately married why is she not present here over all this movie is just bad 
177,you like to solve mysteries you like complex narrations this is for you brilliant clever movie by francis leclerc son of a legendary french canadian signer felix leclerc flashy photo and clever editing is the word of leclerc strongly helped by roy dupuis who s dythirambic in the lead role the plot is about alexandre tourneur veterinary in his 40 s who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer s sufferings on the road throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him not spooky but very mysterious and well played movie i have my hypothesis on the ending i think the indian caused the accident but this ending was open to any explanations i strongly recommend it 9 5 10
798,i don t know why but when i am asked about bad movies i have seen i often think of the air up there i know that technically lots of movies are horrible compared to it and i have seen worse acting it s just that it s so bland so predictable in a word mediocre 
368,chokher bali a passion play based on rabindranath tagore s novel of the same name this is a classic tale of deception adultery and relationship exploitation set in 1900 bengal director rituparno ghosh transformed the nobel laureates acclaimed literature into a delightful visual treat tagore s story elaborately deals with the bengali society through his central character the rebellious widow who wants to live a life of her own we are taken into the picturesque part of bengal where we meet our heroine the beautiful young widow binodini aishwarya rai despite her gorgeous looks two handsome men the rich mahindra prosenjit chatterji and his friend behari toto roychowdhury denied marrying her mahindra chooses a naive ashalata raima sen over binodini and marries her leaving behind the country life the free spirited binodini accompanies mahindra s mother to calcutta as a caretaker soon her friendship with ashalata flourishes it looks like the two addressing each other as chokher bali sand in the eyes share an enduring bond the english speaking binodini captures a special place in the house but soon she unmasks her real face manipulating good natured ashlata binodini gets closer with mahindra and fulfills her sexual desires when she is thrown out by the enraged mother of mahindra binodini seeks solace from a reluctant behari the remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters crisscross and culminate in an unimaginable climax aishwarya walks through the role a manipulative rebellious lady still gaining the viewer s sympathy with a ballet dancer s elegance the other lead artistes prosenjit chatterjee raima sen and toto roychowdhury are equally brilliant in enacting their characters while tagore penned this mould breaking story at the turn of the 20th century the very idea of widow marriage was a taboo even among the upper class narrating the nations freedom movement in parallel the author asserts the importance of individual freedom from the caged life kudos to the art director who gave life to the early 20th century bengal and applause to the cinematographer for capturing those sets with verve this passion play by tagore has been fervently converted to the screen by the ablest filmmaker without loosing its originality 
804,in sum overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes the director and co writer says he wanted to mix genres in this case drama and comedy well at least here these two mix like vinegar and oil to boot the comedy is not very funny and juvenile additionally the film is not really realistic liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex lover s son by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover marriage of convenience and a nutty ex lover at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them either ismael or primarily nora to the detriment of the audience viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael her ex lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball s chance in hell the actors do their best and are appealing but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing editing and lack of focus 
515,like the other guy said it sux you can count the words that have been said in that entire movie on one of your hands too nudity she got naked like 7 or 8 times in a 1 and a half well past the nudity you ll find a porno behind that film he f ked her all movie long bad acting bad story bad language carmen was swearing all movie long so you get out of that movie pornografic scenes and dirty language a lot of gaps in the movie a big silence every now and then the only good thing in that movie is the beautiful places were it has been shot otherwise it s an hour and a half of your life that you ll gonna waste so if u gonna watch that movie good luck it really sux
233,now i like victor herbert and i like mary martin and allan jones but it would have been nice to see a real biography of victor herbert walter connolly as herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter yearsjones and martin sing beautifully though the herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers jones s john ramsay is a frail character very similar to gaylord ravenal in showboat who jones also played as for mary martin it s a mystery why she never had a good hollywood career she did films with bing crosby and dick powell as well as this one she performed well but movie audiences didn t take to her the best musical moment in the film is jones and martin in a duet of thine alone the recordings i have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet there s also a pleasant scene with jones and martin riding bicycles swapping herbert songs as they ride the real victor herbert with his womanizing and his irish patriot background and his musical training in germany where he developed a love for all things german would have been a fascinating study he was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing i have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said cuddles sakall would have been a good victor herbert sakall as irish hello nice movie but the real vic would have been so much better 
4,it ll soon be 10 yrs since this movie was released still makes me laugh if u enjoy this film try the new hera pheri t is as hilarious and my favourite bit of the film must be when salman realises that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point and he actually says it out loud u just wanna bash him but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing fantastic film 10 10
640,i kind of liked the film it s just that the characters run around with no real point to their craziness as i was saying poor goat the goat was nahing while the guy was pretending to grind on it i would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic not the one with the goat though jane ryall who played celia only did this one film she was very nude throughout this crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places i almost forgot about the gay transvestite couple who are also picked out for being sinners if you like crazy off the wall stuff then this is your film 3 10
670,this show is awful how is george wanting the death of his mother funny this show is terrible the parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat george isn t funny especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of spanglish ernie is a loser but at least i ve chuckled at him a few times but mainly at how pathetic he is george s mother benny in an awful despicable character sure her husband left her but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated george as a baby is beyond me can someone explain to me how george s head being big is funny it s not even that big i ve moved on from characters because they re too awful and it would take hours for me to write and i frankly don t care enough i do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom and is not worth your time i give it 2 starts because the wife is extremely attractive 
355,this is the absolutely worst show in the history of nickelodeon first of all no boarding school has a sushi bar flat screen tvs and gives every student a laptop this makes the show so unrealistic and boring the plots are pointless and incredibly boring the actors are so bad it makes me want to take my own life i really hate the fact that in the show zoey is the most popular girl in school and the prettiest and smartest and gets the best grades without doing any work she never has any real problems and every guy wants to date her she is so perfect there isn t anyone like that also i hate that everyone would do anything for her and everyone picks her for every team or club it is so annoying quinn is so obnoxious her experiments are pathetic pointless and fake chase is such a wimp he says he loves zoey but if he told her it would ruin their friendship how pathetic michael tries to be funny but he never accomplishes anything nichole is so perky and screams a lot she is never seen doing any work or studying but she is a straight a student lola thinks she is an actress but she sucks excuse my language need i say more i think no for your own good stay away from this show at all costs 
616,here s a real weirdo for you it starts out with another take off on the psycho shower scene on campus then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for spring break the trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal sheriff dean one of the college cuties wanders into the woods witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open then it s lets rip off macon county line time as dean stalks traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one tony march is on target as the evil shotgun happy dean the movie s overall tone is truly disturbing the ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film it s also a study in despair shallow grave is a must for misanthropes misogynists and nihilists the world over 
100,killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1 bad acting bad characters annoying clown bad lines you name it honestly i m not all that surprised that more people haven t seen this movie the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes they didn t this movie is just as bad if not worse than the first one that clown that goddamn clown i hate him i hate him so much and i don t hate him because he is a good villain i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is unrepairable the last thing we need is a killjoy 3

793,a couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy non seen flicks my friend grabbed head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie well you guessed it it was me i have never been so embarrised in all my life we got home and put it on and we rolled about the floor laughing for about 45mins because this was the funniest film in the world i cant remember much about it but one thing i do remember was the blonde girl getting it on with some guy in the back of a shop every 5 mins that head made me laugh and when i look at other peoples comments aboout this movie it makes me laugh even more head of the family is so good and the head is funny and im still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
362,this film is a fine example of why the shaw brothers are among the finest directors probably the best in the kung fu category the movie is well paced the story is excellent and intriguing and while the humor may not be in your face it is nested within the character interactions once the story builds up and the characters begin to assess the situation does the whole tower come crashing down in one of the best fight scenes tiger crane and crab hung gar are very present there is even a scene that mocks 18th century western social events and ends with clever and entertaining fighting the movie ends with a sudden cheesy moment but if you are a fan of the shaw brothers you ll understand that the cheese is just a topping and not the main course of the movie 
943,the girl in lovers lane 3 out of 10 homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well known phenomenon plenty of dissertations have come out of film schools about the hidden subtexts in such films as top gun and spartacus the girl in lover s lane certainly fits the homoerotic trope in fact it is so blatant and over the top even mst3k whom rarely notes such things in their riffing simply cannot avoid it the film is about two drifters one a rich kid lowell brown running away from home with a hundred dollars and no street smarts the other is a professional hobo brett halsey the hobo saves the kid from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town consisting of a diner a pool hall and a whorehouse our drifter scholar gets a second look from the diner s waitress joyce meadows as the titular girl in lovers lane who clearly is past the age of being choosy and whose only other prospect is creepy jack elam doing a steve buscemi impression on the surface this seems like a strange film for the mst3k treatment while the cast are to old for the characters they are playing the acting is actually pretty good with both brett halsey and jack elam giving solid performances the story is slight but hardly the robot vs aztec mummy material and the production values are cheap back lot but relatively competent it is the strange batman and his ward homosexual undercurrents that make this film both awful and hilarious halsey s over the top objections to the kids attempts to get laid in the whorehouse are hilarious his inability to commit to the waitress or at the least get past first base are telling and the dozens of glances between him and the kid a hand on shoulder the sleeping arrangements blowing off dates with the girl so he and the kid can shave each other you don t have to be freud to figure out this undercurrent 
861, queen of the damned is one of the best vampire movies i had ever seen the movie had suspense action and gore the combination of the fierce demanding attitude of the queen and the rock mood of our star very well acted by stuart townsend makes a wonderfully done movie that only this combination can create i m always the one to give advice to my friends and family members on which movies are worthy of renting and when they ask me if queen of the damned is worthy i tell them it s worthy of buying this movie is most for sure a must have in all horror movie lovers homes 
780,this film s basic premise is a political cartoon i suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a feel good film on gender equality indeed a recent commentator stated it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do what claptrap no one man or woman can do anything they want to do and unfortunately demi moore buffing up for seal hell week in the early 27 week bud s program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a seal is simply not going to make it so there is approximately an 80 dropout rate in what is arguably the roughest military training program those are the ones who voluntarily drop out can t compete on a physical level suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can t handle the psychological harassment i never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived purported message of this film in the real world demi wouldn t last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training wishing alone won t do it skip this film as wishful thinking and better spend your time reading the warrior elite by dick couch crown new york 2001 for the best description as to what really goes on in this training ring the bell demi 
395,keenan ivory wayans is probably one of the worst directors i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie scary movie 2 was ok too but everything else keenan has made are real disasters avoid such titles like don t be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood i know what a title obviously this film too just anything that has keenans name in the credits it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh just trust me on this maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films 1 10 j d seaton
536,i first saw rob roy twelve years ago with little money for entertainment i rented it for my fiancé and i to watch on a bone chilling winter s night the movie i had wanted was gone so i rented this instead not expecting much and was very much surprised with how good it was i just recently watched it again and loved it every bit as much as the first time for those unfamiliar with the story it s about scottish outlaw robert roy macgregor a cattleman and folk hero from the little i know about the man and his story liberties have been taken with the facts but it s a movie not a textbook and so the filmmakers can be excused basically the plot of the movie is that rob roy borrows money from the marquis of montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from but his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the marquis and mary his wife suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of archibald cunningham a smarmy englishman with no soul atrocities ensue until in an immensely satisfying conclusion rob carves archibald up like a christmas turkey there are many great performances in this movie but allow me to touch specifically on a few liam neeson as usual is fantastic a sexy beast you can t take your eyes off of honestly this man is like ice cream even when he s bad he s good his rob roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him in the best way he knows how jessica lange as mary gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure you just know she doesn t take any b s from rob or anyone else for that matter tim roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil archibald yet somehow it works all the posturing and preening combined with some wicked dialogue result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory combine all of this and the stellar work by other supporting players with the luscious scenery of scotland and you have what amounts to one really really cool movie if you haven t seen this i highly recommend that you do 
939,jeff fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous therefore it doesn t really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away drew barrymore fresh off her acclaimed role as poison ivy must have done this film simply as a favor to director phedon papamichael he was the cinematographer on ivy playing a character named daisy drew she s bumped off right away which leaves us with no one to look at but jeff fahey and sean young who hasn t had a single subtle moment on camera since blade runner this witless script by michael angeli concerns a police sketch artist who draws his own wife s face from a murder witness s testimony and while that s not a bad idea for a plot it would be much better suited to an hour long tv series this cable made movie is short on inspiration beginning with the casting and shorter on surprises from 
155,there was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great sadly like bring it on 2 bring it on 3 shamed glory of the original bring it on there is shameless stereotyping throughout the film the lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film the performance of hayden panattiere was sub par both in terms of acting and cheerleading there were several scenes in which i literally cringed because i was embarrassed for the cast because the scene lines plot etc were just so stupid my recommendation to the makers of any future bring it on films is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the acting of the cast was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the film only great character kirresha 
256,well the story is a little hard to follow the first time but that s only because of all the bare breasted 70s painted up vampire witches dancing to the bongo drums this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them and for girl on girl action vampiric or not this movie just rocks 
167,antwone fisher s story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children abandoned by a troubled mother antwone has never met his father growing up with church going abusers who use the n word not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a term of endearment as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold up enduring racial slurs and being teased while serving in the navy antwone s anger is slowly turned into positive power when counseled by a navy psychiatrist and a love enters his life the scene where antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film stunned by the unexpected confrontation the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life without crime addictions to drugs fathering children left and right all despite his utterly adverse circumstances if that scene wasn t powerful enough the very next one drives it home and opens the flood gates a reception to welcome home antwone dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that he is part of this great family one of the messages delivered by this wonderful film is that there are many well meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and unwanted children even if some of the homes and administrators don t seem to care and appear self serving many do give it their all the character who found antwone s file once he disclosed the circumstances of his birth is one of those bright lights in the darkness of the system the dvd includes a french language track various subtitle choices as well as additional features and information about foster parenting as a clevelander i appreciated the location footage no matter where you are from you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem 
735,the movie opens with charlie jeff daniels a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood deli it appears he doesn t have enough cash to cover the check instead of reaching for his plastic he furtively glances around to see if the coast is clear and ducks out of the place without paying unbeknownst to charlie lulu melanie griffith had been observing him from the other side of the deli lulu is decked out in what passed for cool back in the 1980 s with a brunette page boy cut she follows him out to let him know that she saw what he did he tries to deny it but can t escape her accusation thinking he s in it charlie is surprised when lulu says she doesn t work for the deli and then offers him a ride back to work when she heads in the opposite direction thus begins their cavorting across the middle atlantic seaboard we re supposed to get titillated as thoroughly modern lulu puts straight laced charlie into humiliating situations it s all right when the two consenting adults get a little kinky in a motel room but off putting when they wriggle out of paying the check at a family style restaurant stealing the labor from hard working people is not my idea of wild charlie is a jerk lulu is a loony jerk she starts to pass off charlie as her husband first to her mom who blithely tolerates the charade and then at her conveniently timed 10 year high school reunion an event used later by another too cool for its own good movie grosse pointe blank the marriage comes as a surprise to lulu s real husband ray liotta who s just been recently released from prison for armed robbery ray gives the two a welcome comeuppance and shows them how nasty crime really is i can t add any irony by writing that i first watched this by sneaking in the movie theater no i don t do that sort of thing i taped it off of cable tv and assure you i view it strictly in the privacy of my own home so i got to thinking why i taped it when i don t like it very much and conclude that 20 years ago i was on a reggae kick and the soundtrack of something wild does prominently feature reggae the closing credits start with the treat of sister carol performing her version of wild thing 
122, crossfire is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that s a murder mystery with a strong message it stars robert young robert mitchum robert ryan sam levene and gloria grahame and is strongly directed by edward dmytryk we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning and for the rest of the film young as the detective finlay in charge of the case seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death and just as important why the victim joseph samuels sam levene is someone the soldiers meet in a bar they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and samuels winds up dead i don t know about 1947 but seeing crossfire today one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects i don t suppose it was so apparent back then as these actors were just getting started nevertheless the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting good direction violence and unsparing anti semite language the characterizations are vivid including that of gloria grahame in a smallish role she s a woman who meets mitchell george cooper one of the suspect soldiers in a bar and can provide him with an alibi the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan but everyone is excellent robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife truly excellent and a must see 
882,when i think about this movie all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world texture smell color that s how i think this movie should be judged in terms of see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace or the sweltering turkish bath and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin scented oils flickering flames satin rustle don t just watch and listen be absorbed let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you 
204,has the drama suspense and character developments you would enjoy if you like drama that engages you and entertains as well as educates the writers know their material and it shows the direction is always engaging and not blase and the acting terrific why this show didn t win any awards tells me the powers that be in hollyweird don t know drama or much else for that matter there is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played out i m glad it wasn t used as a shock scene for any climatic end to this series which would have been more typical and dull rent this series at once let s hope its brought back from celluloid extinction 
396,this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died idaho colorado territories and montana it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious bad man good man the script is horrible there is very little direction and lousy acting dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade in real life jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city montana to insure that he could never terrorize them again vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately this is a horrible movie i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will even to this day 
763,icarly is about a teenage girl named carly shay miranda cosgrove who lives with her artist brother spencer in a loft in seattle carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes tons of money a year so much money she doesn t even know its a real number her best friend is sam janette mccrudy who s as predictable as they come she says normal things and beats up carly s neighbor freddie who is in charge of all the technical things for their web show carly shouts every word and looks like she doesn t have emotion sam chases freddie around and freddie screams in one episode carly and her friends shoot lewbert the doorman down in elevator and he survives i would not recommend this at all unless you like teenagers shouting hurting people and making fun of stuff 
337,this is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads after all feierstein s flex crush will have you know that real men don t watch anything by truffaut it might have been interesting if truffaut had anything to say here the camera as voyeur motif was nothing new have we all forgotten de sica s bicycle thief or anything by hitchcock so all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as truffaut who spends all his free time screwing up his eyes at the movies who wrecks schoolroom discipline gets accused of plagiarism the many petty thefts and ultimately escapes societal confines to make his own movie sorry been there done that too many times for this to matter 
223,bestselling writer george plimpton alan alda takes on an assignment for sports illustrated he is to go incognito to the detroit lions training camp and try out for a position as third string quarterback he is quickly found out by the team members featuring alex karras and mike lucci the entire team finds it amusing to cause stumbling blocks in the writer s determination to quarterback for a series in a real game this movie is alda s debut and also helped karras leave the gridiron for acting besides the 1968 detroit lions the cast also includes sugar ray robinson roy schieder and lauren hutton alex march directs this story based on plimton s book 
808,heather graham is not just a pretty face she is also an extremely talented actress she adds a unique flavour to the movie overall it s an intelligent and yet compassionate look at love marriage and relationships i thoroughly enjoyed it 
629,renee zellweger is a kansas housewife whose domineering husband is mixed up in drug trafficking two professional hit men morgan freeman and his son chris rock murder the husband in his dining room zellweger unobserved by the killers witnesses this and undergoes a dissociative reaction assuming the personality of a nurse the eponymous betty who is a character in her favorite soap opera believing herself to be the tv character zellweger takes off in her husband s car which has a load of dope in the trunk and travels to la where she hopes to link up with another character in this mindless afternoon drama dr david ravell greg kinnear not realizing she is being pursued by the two hit men she drives to la where she manages to link up with kinnear and is actually written into the show as a nurse named betty a handful of men in the know including the local sheriff catch on to what s happening and also seek zellweger in la the ending is believable and poignant if that sounds crazy it s because it is and it s the writer s responsibility john c richards the curious thing is that richards and the director neil labute with considerable help from the performers just about pull it all off this isn t a plot that has been cast in a familiar mold nope i give it bonus points for sheer originality somebody went out on a limb somebody took a chance on a movie that was not a copy or remake of something that had made money ten years or fifty years ago i imagine the people involved down on their knees every night praying fervently i don t know if the film was remunerative but it s mostly successful on its own aesthetic terms it s what might be called an initial premise movie you start off with a single transformative event in this case the murder of zellweger s husband and her adoption of a genuinely new personality and follow the resultant logical paths realistically groundhog day is another better and more intricately plotted example nurse betty has its logical cracks where the incidents give up their plausibility eg at a party in la zellweger finally runs into kinnear the guy who plays her ex fiancé on tv she s stunned because after all she thinks she s betty who lost her fiancé long ago she approaches kinnear and a couple of his colleagues and introduces herself as nurse betty the character she addresses kinnear by the name of his tv character david ravell the group are puzzled at first then convince themselves that she s an aspiring actress who insists on staying in character during the conversation and afterward too after kinnear has become fascinated by her and the others bored kinnear drives her home and even when she kisses him goodnight she s still in character leaving kinnear wide eyed with astonishment at the relentless way she captures the character of betty on the next date kinnear returns her love that development the relationship between zellweger and kinnear at this point is a crack in the logic the kind that s absent from groundhog day by the end of night one kinnear like any other person would realize that zellweger is a few clowns short of a circus the rest of the film which includes many digressions succeeds beyond expectations the relationship between morgan freeman and his insolent nihilistic son is marvelously spelled out morgan is flawless in his exasperation he manages to fall in love with the image of zellweger as he unearths clues to her whereabouts and activities and at the end he can t bring himself to shoot her she s too sweet to shoot after her transformation into betty she left a note behind in kansas i want to help all life whether it be animal plant or mineral who could harm the author of such a preposterous connative statement his admiration of her comes as an epiphany as he stands near one of the floodlights at the rim of the grand canyon zellweger dressed as dorothy or maybe the good witch of the east well characters that like zellweger are from kansas anyway appears to freeman and he embraces her and kisses her tenderly it s a scene that s at once eerie romantic and a little spooky i once stood at one of those lights and threw some shredded paper into the updraft from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand swirling bats who had misperceived the fluttering shreds as moths right where was i okay i was trying not to run out of space zellweger s performance deserves plaudits everything she does every movement every utterance is naive and tentative she really is a likable character and that despite the fact that she s no glamor girl by hollywood standards but what an actress compare her performance as the bumptious 19th century hick in cold mountain just the opposite but then everyone is up to snuff in this enjoyable film allyson jannings does a fine job in a minor role watch her when she tells greg kinnear that she s considering killing off his character in the soap opera in a drowning accident kinnear is one of those narcissists who wears the kind of ten thousand dollar thin black leather jackets that were popular at the time he chuckles and says oh one of those castaway deals right okay how do i get back jannings doesn t answer she just smiles at him with those enormous blue eyes and tilts her head mockingly not a masterpiece of film making but a good original professional job by everyone concerned 
975,the big knife a movie about the dark side of the hollywood motion picture industry is ironically far more like a filmed play than a film itself apart from a few very brief expository scenes all of the action takes place in the living room of the film s hero played by jack palance he s a movie actor who wants out of his contract with his studio because of the lack of redeeming qualities in the films they put out his on again off again wife ida lupino is also fed up with the studio not to mention her husband s philandering ways unfortunately for them both the head of the studio rod steiger is a real bastard he has blackmail material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract but it s only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far this film is not i repeat not a film noir rather it s an exceptionally theatrical sitting room melodrama the plot proceeds at a snail s pace and is so intricate and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with the static setting and carefully contrived blocking of the actual scenes the acting is overwrought in the extreme and veers sharply between out and out histrionics and softer but no less unsubtle soliloquies that are obviously meant to be poignant but come across as pretentious twaddle especially in the hands of the woefully miscast palance aldrich was obviously going all out for a stylized something here but i doubt even he knew what it was and certainly the audience never does i think the main lesson here is that films and plays are very different mediums what might have worked in a play did not come across as even remotely natural or plausible on film the result a big waste of time there s little to enjoy here 
990,christophe lambert once said he was still making movies only to make good and easy money when i see his latest releases i can believe that beowulf is all in all in the good part of the crap movies there are some good thrill scenes indeed the actors themselves aren t too bad but the plot is silly the mortal kombat like music has nothing to do here the ending is really s y really the only good thing about it is that me and my friends could laugh about how uninteresting it was i even wish i wasted my money on something else 
111,i tend to fall in and out of love with anime as the more you watch the more you notice a lot of shows are just poor copies of the few gems or rehashes of old formulas but every once in a while one of the true gems comes along and it s originality just blows you away haruhi is truly one of those shows many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation into an animated show is rather poorly done and doesn t utilize the benefits animation has over static drawings haruhi is actually based on a series of light novels and fires on all cylinders beautiful animation great voice acting great music and a complete and well paced story watch it you won t be disappointed and i d suggest watching it in broadcast order it works so much better that way 
478,frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns he was a great actor from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that but he did not have the physique of a western hero you identified him as an urban guy but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault i blame it on two factors a the story was too unusual specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern to break away from it the film has to be very good b the story is not convincing it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible why all the gunfighters have not adopted it i think that this film should not have been withdrawn because any film with sinatra is worth seeing and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable
932,who gave these people money to make a movie there was nothing funny about it the fact that the farting dog was the funniest thing about this piece of sickness says it all first of all it has nothing to do with christmas it just took the name and counted on all those people who liked the chevy chase original they took randy i have no talent i m just a fat and sweaty pig quaid the only wrong thing about part 1 and made a movie about him there are only morons in his family but not the aren t they cute kinda moronic but the don t touch me kinda moronic watching this pile of dirt helps you hope that everyone who takes part in it dies they didn t even bother to get the effects in order when they re on the boat the only thing that moves is the fake background when pigface quaid is in the water you can tell by the lighting that it s in a studio this movie was sexist uncle nick racist uncle nick and should never have been made never throwing the money into a volcano would have had so much more use well i hope i reached some of you nobody warned me and now i m scarred for life merry f cking christmas
154,black water has to be one of the best australian movies i ve seen in many years my girlfriend and i sat gripping each others hands jumping in all the right spots this is as much a crocodile film as open water was a shark film in other words the creatures are merely part of the dilemma the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances how director s andrew traucki and david nerlich wring as much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is amazing to watch unfold and when i say terror its not overblown artificially constructed squirm moments but more little touches that when you ask yourself how would i feel in that situation lead you to conclude scared witless performances were great the pacing and gorgeous cutaways to other life in the mangroves were excellent and the ending moments of the film felt very right this is a fitting feature debut for two directors who should rightfully by very proud go and watch this very beautifully shot and acted suspenseful film 
695,this is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good even though some of the actors and actresses weren t very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old it was funny gross and just all out a very good movie in most parts i just didn t know what was going to happen next i was like i think this is going to happen wait i think this is going to happen all age groups will love this movie in some parts i couldn t stop laughing it was so funny but in some parts i was totally grossed out and i couldn t believe what i was seeing i am definitely going to see this movie again it is one of those movies where it can t get boring every time you see it is so suspenseful i definitely recommend seeing this movie 
84,i don t see the point it s ponderous the animated people are creepy look up uncanny valley scenes go on and on and on for very little purpose the plot is skeletal and must be padded out with lots of meaningless dramatic screaming roller coaster rides as if disney or spielberg were planning an amusement park ride based on the movie most of the characters are annoying and unlikeable some of them keep showing up as if they will have something important to add to a climactic scene they don t they just vanish with no lasting impact somebody summed it up as if you don t believe in santa claus you ll be kidnapped on a train on christmas eve that pretty much sums it up 
357,the only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anguish of romance if you are expecting this cinematic adaptation of another nicholas sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of previous films such as message in a bottle nights at rodanthe and a walk to remember think again nobody dies from an accident trying to save somebody else and the romance here doesn t transform these characters if anything it makes them even more miserable than they were a soft spoken special forces army sergeant john tyree channing tatum of g i joe has a memorable two week fling while on leave from the military with an impressionable college girl savannah curtis radiant amanda seyfriend of mamma mia who is spending spring break in south carolina savannah doesn t drink smoke but she tells john that her head is filled with profanity inevitably john and savannah topple madly in love with each other and launch an endless exchange letters of love letters that are sleep inducing by any standard tyree is off in the world serving the military in some godforsaken corner of the globe while she is away at college perusing his letters in class just as they are getting hot and heavy between them suicidal terrorists crash planes into the world trade center john reenlists along with his buddies in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with savannah meanwhile another guy shaggy but likable family friend tim henry thomas of e t the extra terrestrial who has a motherless autistic child named alan becomes the object of savannah s sentiment she is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children she delays what seems forever before she finally contacts tyree with the eponymous letter indeed she dumps him for a man with a disease later she confesses to john that she knew the sound of his voice would have broken her resolve to marry tim so she doesn t make that fateful call predictably john agonizes over savannah s lack of communication during a routine mission our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and winds up in germany while all this is transpiring tyree is trying to come to terms with his own coin collecting father mr tyree richard jenkins of step brothers who suffers from asperger s syndrome it seems that his father is on his last legs after john gets out of the hospital the lead female character lacks a shred of respect and her betrayal of tyree amounts to a pretty low blow tyree his father and tyree s commander keith robinson are the only sympathetic characters in this long distance epistolary romance dear john gives new meaning to lethargic love stories yuck 
570,yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money just how commercial did this film prove the film council who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded on one of the london undergrounds disused stations for allowing this clichéd dismal specimen to be committed to film a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate most notably deathline amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute it s a little bit too late then surely all those development executives at the uk film council could have noticed this at the script stage add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare 
457,i just saw this movie tonight opening night it was great i m a big fan of sports movies and this was right up there as one of my favorites dennis quaid was great oh by the way mr quaid if you read this my sister lives in austin where you live and she was supposed to buy you a drink once well she kinda stood you up but she didn t mean to c not that anyone s going to believe that anyway it s a great movie everyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see it c 
800,i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan a culture i know very little about i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint i watched this with someone who didn t read the book and he also enjoyed it they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over you feel for the characters and their plights i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime 
959,this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original cartoon there s this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are it s atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn t bother me so much so that i didn t even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all it s miserably forgettable the only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja 
696,one of the better made for tv biopics i just wish it had told us more i have read many biographies and seen other things about the carpenters and this movie did what it could based on the constraints placed on it by the family cynthis gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring karen to life one of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into karen s anorexia in the reading i have done about the disease especially cherry boone o neill s wonderful book starving for attention anorexia appears to be a disease of control karen saw her weight as one thing in her life that she could control she felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life don t get me wrong i believed she truly loved the music but she felt she had little control over her career she truly loved her family but they did not express it well and she didn t know how to make her family understand her the film could have touched so much more on that i treasure the music i have of the carpenters and wish she was still alive to contribute more to music today 
182,with harry callahan getting up in years the inevitable old man with a chip on his shoulder story had to come into play eventually callahan looking fragile sometimes and out of place his demeanor still was unwavering thankfully this film took some time off to develop a different type of story one that might reinvent the dirty harry and the whole genre while the film fell short in doing so it was still an excellent addition to the series even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and new wave music 
892,eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in 1985 to totally abysmal now it s such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings the ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting ever characters name in a hat the first two out regardless of their sex will sleep with each other the 3rd 4th out will have a fight in the vic the 5th one will be arrested the 6th develop an addiction 7th get pregnant etc etc the producers are clever though the 30 minute show is only actually ever comprised of 3 lines 1 someone will walk in the vic say what s goin on 2 someone else will stand up say leave it aht out 3 then a woman will say doan choo come in ere n insult mah fam ly that s it that s every show apart from the occasional get it sort id is it sort id the show was once a realistic portrayal of east end folk their way of life the buffers came off when 1 they extended it from two nights a week 2 the slater family turned up how they attract viewers is beyond me the kat character symbolizes everything that s gone wrong with society treating anyone else like something she s pulled off the bottom of her shoe the people who vote her the best character in these polls must the same as the ones that vote jamie redknapp best sportsman despite the fact he hasn t played a game for 3 years what i can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of british tv why do all the biggest names leave ross kemp martin kemp the list is endless how long has the longest couple s marriage lasted with them being faithful to each other yes people leave but until the script writers realise that characters couple can be interesting likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate an episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that and zoe the doctor top even lofty shell as most unconvincing couple ever to appear on tv yes eastenders is the most watched show thats undisputed but many external factors contribute to that 19 30 20 00 is the perfect time of day to gain the most audience figures it has an omnibus edition for 2 hours and more than that millions of the viewers watch it out of nothing more than habit but if they were completely honest to themselves they would admit that in 2002 more than ever it can be absolutely pitiful 
125,i m a big time horror fan and i bought this movie from all the hype it was getting on the message boards well let me tell you i don t know whom was giving it all the hype but let me speak on a few things first of all this film is not a lot of things it is not scary not suspenseful not overly gory not overly sick except for one season maybe not beautifully scored at all the premise of the movie is that a couple flee to a small island in greece because they have done a little naughtiness in london we don t even know what they did but it is presumed that they killed someone spoiler alert the male lead kills a few people out of his perversion of cleansing the island of perverts oddly enough the killings are cheap the characters are cheaper and the effects suck there is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning but even that is done without any care for how it is shot end of spoilersthe end of the movie is about the only thing that isn t totally predictable i especially enjoyed when the herder farts on the husband anyway if you can rent this and have 2 hours to waste go ahead it s nothing better than a processed cheese sandwich on moldy bread 3 10
513,this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to directing destiny decided that this was indeed his last and what a film rouge the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and durenmatt immediately comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have staged little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a study in red as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene jacob and jean louis trintignant the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age a great film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape 9 10 on my personal scale 
907,as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat 3 i ve purchased that s been made recently i wasn t sure what to expect a cambodian hit man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the arrangements for the hit man because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hit man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hit man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hit man to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie it s like a roller coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit man the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking there s no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off dog eat dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an r1 release for sure great movie highly recommended 
60,an unfunny unworthy picture which is an undeserving end to peter sellers career it is a pity this movie was ever made 
311,the cover on the dvd and disc is freaking awesome you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea but this movie s actors are worst then ben s performance in pearl harbor porno s have better quality and better actors i was gonna buy the dvd but luckily i rented it first the plot and script are also horrible nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense the poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80 s sitcom shows and in the end it ll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house 
877,i ve always knew anne desalvo was a great character actor now i know she is a great writer director also i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect my favorite year dc cab and stardust memories it s so rare to see lee grant these days in anything she has been missing from the screen for far too long it s also wonderful to see cloris leachman in something other than a sit com this is her best work since the last picture show if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie i wasn t expecting a lot when i started watching this movie so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie if you get the chance watch it 
854,zachary scott does what he does best i e plays a worm in danger signal a 1945 b movie also starring faye emerson mona freeman and rosemary decamp scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money on the lam from his last murder he rents a room in the home owned by the fenchurch family hilda emerson and her mother mary servoss scott throws himself at emerson and she s dazzled mid romance her younger sister anne freeman comes home from a medical treatment when she mentions that she was uncle wade s favorite and he left her 25 000 big bucks by 1945 standards scott loses interest in poor hilda and makes a play for anne anne looks like rebecca of sunnybrook farm until she starts sneaking around with scott overnight she ages 10 years and becomes downright nasty to her sister finally getting the message that her tenant is no good hilda calls in a psychiatrist rosemary decamp to psyche him out and advise her psychological dramas were all the rage during and after world war ii and scott does an excellent job as a smooth sociopath this was his forte as a weak willed sheriff in flamingo road he exhibited no real presence as for two timing we saw him do that in mildred pierce where he proved himself particularly good at it emerson is a bookish stenographer with her hair pushed off her face and her big glasses but after hours she s lovely and gives a strong performance decamp was always an underrated actress here she sports a soft german accent and is delightful this is a highly entertaining film though a very routine story the acting truly elevates it 
864,what the beep is going wrong with disney the last years are there totally run out of good ideas where is the magic where are the good animators the good songwriters the good directors the good okay i know walt himself and the famous nine old man can t come back but is this a reason to crank out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of walt disney i never rent or bought a disney sequel of what movie however because i had read much enough about its absence of quality but atlantis milo s return was aired today on tv in germany and so i watch it it confirmed my doubts about sequels it was absolutely boring flaw animation primitive color rotation simple characters some unsuccessful tries to simulate the famous multiplane camera with cgi mediocre music and a patchwork of different simple stories it looks absolutely not like disney not like disney i know it looks like one of the countless cheap and simple animation series like dragonballz beyblade etc that aired every day on tv for children my first reaction after showing this crap was to load bambi in my dvd player to see disney s immortal magic depth spirit and charm again to see disney on its climax again to see the awesome art of handmade animation again bambi was the first and until today the only movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars but atlantis milo s return no magic no depth no charm no spirit it deserved only 3 out of 10 
926,like several other reviewers here i m surprised to see many negative reviews on this film dan o bannon s previous effort was the groundbreaking alien of 1979 because it and star wars introduced the stylistic approach of used or dirty space in art direction for these kinds of features doesn t mean that this was the only way to produce them rather than dismiss lifeforce out of hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature it s important to recognize that the film draws upon the esteemed traditions of british horror and science fiction specifically hammer and american international features like quatermass specifically quatermass and the pit 1967 doctor who and the day of the triffids 1963 if not the works of gerry anderson ufo space 1999 and thunderbirds but none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer o bannon s genre scholarly appreciation for queen of blood 1966 and it the terror from beyond space 1958 the immediate sources for alien 1979 granted this film has some legacy elements but perhaps it s worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers 1981 s an american werewolf in london and the company of wolves 1984 other 80 s films that share a looking back while they adapt those stories to the 80 s zeitgeist all three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same but substantially sexed up their themes because they could and at the same time they recognized the tongue in cheek humorous aspects of their projects neil jordan s wolves played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the 80 s while american werewolf curdled its theme as a coming of age film it s called artistic license and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter day dramedy inherent in the scream franchise i know what you did last summer and final destination but these teen targeted films seem to be part of a box office trend whereas the 80 s films like lifeforce belong a canon of british sci fi even if this one was written by an american in many ways this film holds up much better than latter day disaster and alien invasion flicks independence day armageddon deep impact in that the solutions don t reside in gun battles weaponized payloads and testosterone at the opposite end of the pole it is unfortunate that steven soderbergh and james cameron didn t examine tarkowski and lem more closely before they remade solaris the goal of this film was fun not ponderousness or stupidity 7 10
514,paul verhoeven genius and master film maker strikes back with the less than perfect yet still fun in a dirty old man type of way hollow man the first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints yet i am giving a recommendation to this film for it s mind blowing special effects perhaps the best so far around and two dandy performances by the leads verhoeven s moral questions are of course thought provoking and although the film turned off many this movie is pretty soft core for old verhoeven two major flaws josh brolin aka walking ape man and the whole deal with the elevator if there was an access ladder why were they trapped down in the lab a fun horror film for a saturday night 
778,this movie is so bad it s good in an unintentionally funny way i couldn t stop watching it i was laughing so much it s like a parody of a romantic thriller except it s not a parody alexandra paul plays emily wendell an oppressed preacher s wife who falls hard for luke corey sevier a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison the only thing sevier is guilty of though is bad acting mind you he s no worse than the other actors you get the sense that the actors have no idea they re in a really awful film they re playing it straight everything about the film is bad the acting the script the love scenes the pacing the plot twists the choice of music the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous first the shootout in the church then luke s final words to emily i was howling with laughter evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison and we get to see plenty of his naked torso that s probably the highlight of the film 
321,i ve seen a great many films but in cold blood stands alone in a class by itself it excels in every department the fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story rather than the name on the marquee blake and wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo the fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place even inside the very house add additional chills the black white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent there are many outstanding cinematic works out there but if i could only vote for one to top the list it would most probably be in cold blood 
983,anyone who visited drive ins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films wherever movie goers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the 50s came horror movies like voodoo woman and the undead in the 60s were frankie avalon annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like the glory stompers and into the 70s aip churned out grindhouse level trash like cannibal girls and sugar hill dillinger released in 1973 is one of the more highbrow aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriter director john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career the 109 minute dillinger epic for aip s scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in 1933 4 dillinger is basically a chase film with purvis s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover dillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillinger s strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn t there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967 s bonnie and clyde but we simply don t get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shoot em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail aside from this the picture s main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger is just a film it s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as milius s screenplay and the film s documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldn t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them warren oates s performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it s really too bad that milius s screenplay didn t flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a briefly appearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talent as a piece of 1970s exploitation dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgm s dvd release for 4 99 the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts the film doesn t really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre it s certainly worth checking out out of 4roving reviewer www geocities com paul_johnr
740,made after quartet was trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham here the three stories are the verger mr know it all and sanitorium the first two are comic the verger is like a prolonged joke but one with a good pay off and the last more serious as health issues are involved again the author introduces the film and the stories james hayter soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick is the hero in the verger he holds this small custodial type job in a church but the new vicar michael hordern is an intellectual snob when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him hayter has saved some money so he tells his wife kathleen harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop he has a good eye and his store thrives soon he has a whole chain of stores when his grandchild is christened by hordern the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex verger the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments i ll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting according to maugham he met a man like max kelada nigel patrick on a cruise in mr know it all kelada is a splashy friendly and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship his state room mate is mr grey the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde white who is somewhat silently disapproving of max max likes to enliven things and soon is heavily involved in the ship s entertainment at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non maugham story and film china seas 1935 as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real i won t describe the way max rises to the occasion sanitorium is the longest segment roland culver plays ashenden the fictional alter ego of maugham a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock s the secret agent here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health he finds a remarkable crew of people including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman finlay currie as an irascible scotsman john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is at war with currie raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions the last dealing with simmons and rennie is ironic but deeply moving it was a dandy follow up to the earlier quartet and well worth watching 
68,oh god what an idiotic movie incredibly cheap with fake special effects the creature is played by one guy in lame costume and stupid plot all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ha ha ha they re simply ludicrous for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more all in all this is a great entertainment if you re drunk avoid it like the plague am i drunk i don t think so 
29,certain dvd s possess me until i just have to go out and buy it this was one of those movies like many on here i remember seeing it as a child and loved it i never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut so i was intrigued to see what they might be i will agree that the portabellow road sequence is now a tad long as is the soccer game but other than that i found no qualms with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place perhaps disney should have had the original version which is the restored version on one side with the restored version on the flip side then people could choose what they wanted to view all in all it s still an entertaining movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories 
701,this has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films i have ever seen merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence sex and a minimalist retelling of the life of jesus christ the high contrast and thick layer of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times but the use of texture combined with the extreme contrast create an incredible viewing experience this film is not for everyone i think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content which if extremely rough but does make a fairly important statement about creation god and humanity whether this film is a work of art or shock value trash is open to discussion 
886,i saw this play on showtime some years back in the comfort of my home and when the final note was struck i wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a standing ovation as it was i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs for my birthday my kids bought me the vhs version as well as the cd of the play with len cariou in the sweeny todd role i ve shared the play with many some finding the subject a bit sick but none having anything but praise for the songs i ve always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george hearn as well as hearn and edmund lyndeck as judge turpin i must own the dvd 
25,i guess if you are into the sci fi and horror stuff it might be interesting the acting was okay but not great the two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty one at the time the plot is okay but the story does jump around a bit leaving one guessing whether you re in boston or pennsylvania the priest seems to use warp speed between the two the catholic church is portrayed as having a secretive sect for investigating events which only happen to those of that faith what if the two girls had been protestant would the catholics of cared therefore some what contrived who knows some day the catholic church might even learn what the bible teaches if you miss this one don t feel you ve lost anything 
618,anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal the author of the novel and screenplay to air her prejudices grievances and general antipathy towards the english the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight violent foul mouthed promiscuous engaging in child neglect stupid uneducated racist ugly eating poor food and dim witted tellingly only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be redeemed at the end of the film by contrast the indian family are beautiful clever educated can speak many languages are caring and loving parents and grammar school fodder the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all had it been the other way round an english family in an indian community depicted this way the film would have been seen as racist there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead i thought it would lodge in my hairline first the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration undertext the english are dirty and promiscuous and the men undertext english women are prostitutes second the meal with anita where neema s family lie to her about cutlery undertext the english are so stupid you can make them do anything but the underlying contempt towards anything english even english weddings are an object of scorn is evident all the way through the film the character of anita was drawn so appallingly almost the fallen woman trope that i finished the film feeling angry this is not a bend it like beckham where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community s behaviour and customs from somebody within that community and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together instead anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste and this is underscored by a thinly veiled series of attacks upon the film s other community the english i felt anita and me is a hate filled grievance based piece of work on that basis the bbc should not have funded its production 
301,i enjoy the national anthem i enjoy the national anthem if for nothing else then just before the midnight news i imagine i m playing the cymbals in the band not as easy as you may think one two three four one two three four but then what so i have sympathy with the practising bass drum player in roy andersson s wonderful film patiently waiting for his cue listening to a very 70s cassette player the 70s motif seems to continue throughout with some classic soulless furniture moreover every scene has an eerie jade wash which emphasises the minute nuances of the subtlest of acting which brings me to jessika lundberg s outstanding purple boots boots which otherwise would have inspired a silk cult advertising campaign but then the difficult bit someone asked me what it was about well there is a scene where the opening line as i don t have that length in green brilliant straight out of a gary larson carton i can t say what it s about go see yourself ron plasmahmm larson sounds swedish viewed 15apr08 
467,yes be my love was mario lanza s skyrocket to fame and still is popular today his voice was strong and steady so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood i used to practise singing his songs years ago and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysema asthma ten years ago reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful 
971,this movie is all flash and no soul the actors put a lot of passion into the numbers but these numbers often didn t connect with the film and felt like stand alone music videos and no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you every single one sounds like its coming from a studio essentially sucking all the life from the songs off the stage the performances were all dull and unrealized especially hudson who essentially plays the same angry strong she s stubborn and selfish black woman we ve seen before there was absolutely no depth to her character nor any of the other female leads though i think the movie wants us to believe that hudson s character faces hardship because of her weight it is really her own refusal to do what s best for the team that lands her in trouble making the end of the film totally meaningless hudson s academy award is a joke there was no justification when she sang she put forth emotion though it was often misplaced but this was the writer director s fault but when she was just acting she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character eddie murphy s character is the only one with an arc and he did a fine job but still not oscar worthy the only actor who really brought something to the roll was danny glover who took a small relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it there is nothing here to sink your teeth into no drama or heart or even laughs the placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one the number when hudson is arguing with the other girls is so long winded if it had been any longer it could pass for a family guy skit the movie has no idea what it s about and i felt insulted by the last few minutes it s a big boring waste of time and really is the worst film i saw in 06 and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with 
348,except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads this movie is really really bad the cheap production values don t help of course you wouldn t really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn t keep trying to convince you they had a production values to begin with even for a b movie genre freak like myself this movie really sucks 
558,the release of tarzan the ape man in 1932 caused a sensation it may be hard to believe 70 years later but the film had much of the same kind of impact as the matrix or the lord of the rings has achieved at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment tarzan became an instant pop icon the noble savage that every woman fantasized about and every man wished he could be the only person unhappy about the situation was edgar rice burroughs who while he d agreed to mgm s creative liberties and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks felt the dumbed down version of his character with no plans to allow him to grow was unfaithful to his vision he would start a production company and soon be making his own tarzan films mgm realizing the value of it s newest star knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original and tarzan and his mate delivered the film had an interesting back story cedric gibbons mgm s legendary art director had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel prior to the release of tarzan the ape man despite the fact that he d never directed before the studio hadn t anticipated the film s impact and didn t think a novice director would matter much on a novelty film and they wanted to keep their oscar winning department chief happy gibbons a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist loved the freedom of pre code hollywood and decided to have tarzan and his mate push the envelope to the limit tarzan and jane would frolic in a nude swim and jane would appear topless through most of the film maureen o sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death in 1998 that while a double was used for the swim she trusted the studio and did a couple of days of filming sans top but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples and the idea was abandoned the film shot those days would be worth a fortune she did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her swim and donned a revised jungle costume that was extremely provocative very thin and open at the sides and the resulting outcry would help create the hays office and the self censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry mgm yanked gibbons from the production the official reason given was his workload as art director and veteran jack conway was listed as the new director to appease the critics although james c mckay actually directed the film as conway was busy on 3 other projects including viva villa the film incorporated the best elements of the original safaris murderous tribes tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save jane and actually improved on the storytelling harry holt neil hamilton from the first film returns to africa for ivory from the elephants graveyard and to try to seduce jane into returning to england with gifts of silk dresses underwear and perfume he brings with him martin arlington paul cavanagh a crack shot and inveterate womanizer who sneers at holt s chivalrous pursuit of jane and stalks her as a potential conquest to be had by any means including killing tarzan if and when he can get away with it without being seen tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with jane and puts his foot down refusing to allow the hunters into the graveyard arlington finds his opportunity catching the ape man alone and shoots him then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise now jane has no reason to remain in the jungle and she can direct them to the graveyard before her long voyage back to england comforted by the oh so sympathetic arlington but a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group can tarzan being nursed back to health by his ape family recover in time to save jane while stock footage is again used extensively the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits tarzan and his mate achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other tarzan film as well as a sexiness that even bo derek s blatantly erotic tarzan the ape man couldn t touch johnny weissmuller was in peak condition physically maureen o sullivan was never more beautiful and africa never looked more romantic and dangerous tarzan and his mate was a triumph although it would be drastically edited for many years and remains the classic of the series to this day 
498,if you like sci fi monsters and ancient legends then you will love this movie the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago while the acting may have been a little less than desirable the story line and effects adequately compensated for it i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen tv if you like non stop action awesome visuals and taste for myth and lore you have to see this movie 
351,the cinemascope color cinematography of leon shamroy is quite remarkable here including his use of colored filters forvarious scenes the alfred newmann score has to be the most sensual and seductive score hollywood ever produced it s a shame it is no longer available on cd the actors however never rise to the occasion the accents are so varied from the subdued british of ustinov and purdom to the hollywood of baxter and mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision tommy rettig is jarringly american acting styles span the range from zombie like to stilted only ustinov as a conniving one eyed servant steals the show what there is of it to steal the premise the story of a young egyptian doctor seduced and abandoned by the rich and the parallel theme of the cult of the single god ra persecuted by the authorities has its interesting points but when the film s plot fades it is the haunting music and visuals that remain 
930,what a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject there is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight or gay man working in a gay sexual environment the dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic component they may not all be prostitutes for hire but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered from the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the dancers for private sessions even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the dancers only playing to the women in the audience this just isn t the reality of these clubs it would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples so what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients we learn very little instead we get filler a gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers a manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers lives and attitudes the pictures of mexico city are generic the phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous this is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing the rest of the movie is an insult to gay men 
601,return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original it had black humor good suspense nice looking girls and of course a psycho killer what are we missing i think nothing except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television besides being one of the best sequels it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family recommended for everyone 
74,i really liked the movie the emporer s new groove but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having relations with a llama seriously this movie was bad it s like club dread after super troopers i am supposed to write 10 lines but i don t even know what else to say i laughed a couple of times but only because i was drinking a movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk it was not maybe llamas are just funny and regular cartoon people aren t either way just stick with the emporer s new groove if you want a funny cartoon llama themed movie line 10 is this line right here 
381,this is one of those cheaply made tv movies were the characters seem to lose all sense the premise of the story the kidnapping of a son by the boy s father is very good but the story just seems to beggar belief whenever the mother is advised not to do anything you know fine well she is going to do it it is a bit far fetched and not worthy of a viewing 
718,there are films that are not released in theaters but on video this one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does no story inept violence over acted badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film and i did like and enjoyed some of siegel s other movies 
18,master kieslowsky came with an idea in 1993 the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today passing from blue a crafted visual masterpiece about a woman s life from white a visual comedy movie about marriage and finally arriving to red a masterpiece dealing with human interaction while i m not going to spoil the move i can easily say red is the best movie from the 90 s decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script i have ever ever seen the movie begins a little slow but finds it s rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole movie the performances are perfect sublime since the characters are completely realistic and they re not clichéd in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesn t get disappointed seriously i believe jean louis tringtignat deserved an oscar nod at least the music from zbiegnew preisner is amazing it s one of the best musical scores ever piotr sobocinsk cinematography is also outstanding he got an oscar nod for it and deserved to win overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who don t don t miss it how did the awful pulp fiction beat ed this masterpiece at cannes is beyond my comprehension
463,pure schlock from beginning to end the average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination otherwise it s a pure camp fest endurance test like one of those so so episodes of star trek the next generation that thinks it has something important to say you ll see every plot twist a mile off in this by the numbers romp however it s worth seeing for its portrayal of drag king prostitutes a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them how s that for role reversal and lesbian soap operas the ghost of valerie solanis lives 
816,not many people remember the carey treatment and i can t say i blame them blake edwards did this during his lean years i e between pink panther movies and for a story of a doctor turned detective coburn working to solve a murder in his hospital it s actually pretty forgettable coburn is dependable as always and o neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings the story twists and turns aren t very involving and even the climax which is supposed to be nerve wracking is gut wrenching instead a missed opportunity altogether and an unfortunate one at that since it was based on a michael crichton book oh well at least crichton didn t write a sequel to it one star carey on coburn 
418,first of all season 1 is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional they re nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchair bound augustus hill who is played impressively by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what s taking place in the show unfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a men s club with guards guards that don t do much near the end of season two an older prisoner s grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of 20 and 50 bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even adibisi wanted to be nice but that s okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distraction later shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators let s see what else shillinger s son od s in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he just got them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise you ll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums i didn t know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr faraj s schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and o reilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a gun i shouldn t go on about stupid ideas in this show but it s like a flood i can t stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who can t speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless they re needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robson s gum transplant what s the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesn t belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again it s like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasn t bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mind i also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they don t say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you don t think i m gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience won t remember maybe i m spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a low budget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multi season tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i don t understand myself 
37,dressed to kill starts off with kate miller angie dickinson having a sexually explicit nightmare later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr robert elliott michael caine for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated unfulfilled in her current marriage kate then visits a museum picks up a stranger they go back to his apartment for casual sex when done kate is set to leave but is attacked killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman prostitute liz blake nancy allen discovers the gruesome scene sees the killer but manages to escape detective marino dennis franz says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate s son peter keith gordon to track down the real killer clear liz s name see that justice is done written directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery the script is measured slow at times but it likes to focus on the character s so you really know them the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off then the film switches it s attentions to liz no one else gets a look in this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing engaging unfortunately the character s themselves aren t exactly likable i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you d have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill it s a good film but it didn t excite me that much i didn t really find any character to root for or like the film tacks on a needless unnecessary twist ending that i didn t really see the point of director de palma directs with style visual flair from the art museum sequence to a car chase as a whole it s impeccably filmed throughout i d imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it i felt the film was a bit flat uninspired at times though nothing about it really excited me that much there is a fair bit of nudity some sex rape along with a few bits of gore violence kate s murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight if that s the right word however it s by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe with a supposed budget of about 6 500 000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film the new york locations are nice the cinematography is good as a whole it s extremely well made i thought the music was inappropriate was far to loud intrusive the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn t think caine had that much screen time allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them this blow out 1981 he cast her as a prostitute a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn t think it quite lived up to it s lofty reputation good but not brilliant 
954,this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron the acting is second rate poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film and god help gina gershon her accent is too over the top it sounds nothing like an true english woman it sounds forced and phony much like her acting she should stick to what she does best lesbian showgirl con artist who plays in a rock roll band and has a drug problem the other characters are no better they are two dimensional empty vapid and silly how are we to supposed to care about these people at one point christy scott cashman get s lost in central park really it s not that hard to navigate central park just follow any path out not only did i not care about any of the characters i downright hated them the only reason i even stayed with this train wreck of a film was fisher stevens even his brilliant humor couldn t save this dying fish each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us the script was awful as was the acting if you catch this fish throw it back 
609,this documentary is not only one of the best documentaries i ve seen but also one of the most moving and quietly beautiful movies i ve seen period it follows the lives of two sudanese young men peter and santino as they try to make their way into the american culture peter and santino are friends at first but they gradually drift more and more apart as peter goes to kansas city and santino stays in houston a land called houston santino s beauty is in his eyes he takes people onto his back he supports an apartment full of other sudanese paying the rent doing everything for other people he is a quiet sufferer peter looks out for himself getting a high school education while playing basketball and making christian friends it seems that director megan mylan did not know what she was getting herself into with the beauty of this tale peter and santino are amazing characters that move you but the real strength in this movie lies in its commentary on american society it is not judging it shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be to outside people i suggest you find this film and look at america through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people my grade 10 10
997,ed wood is eclipsed and becomes orson welles this film is fantastic vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter plan 9 from outerspace dons t stand a chance against this described by the writer and psychic stephen armourae on the vampire forum as a masterpiece he s from england and thoroughly sarcastic it has stephanie beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers and eileen daly is just a lower rate elvira the whole thing is badly done watch it for the script though
915,to be honest this film is another in a series of huge disappointments most of these so called masters of horror films are only horrifying in terms of their sub par effects and laughable story lines aside from ron perlman everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life the gunshots sounded like someone was playing bop it under the boom mike or something and looked completely unrealistic overall this film is about as scary as home alone the only good masters are cigarette burns jennifer and maybe pelts i don t know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand 
271,you can survive surviving christmas i thought the television version was a bit edited way down i like ben afleck he plays drew johnson a family less adult who is willing to pay complete strangers the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco the daughter drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn t have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars bill macy who i best remember for playing maude s husband arthur is hired to play duda the grandfather when the whole situation comes crashing down the truth can be painful the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation drew s rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit you can t buy what you wish for the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene 
532,walter matthau and jack lemmon both of whom are sadly missed proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen this film is just another example of this this time out they play two brothers in law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board of course their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named gil godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys it s hilarious how lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat s owner rue mclanahan too bad that fellow dance instructors hal linden and donald o connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that matthau falls for dyan cannon on board with her fellow gold digging mother the usual outrageous elaine stritch unknown to them matthau has no money either the widower lemmon falls for gloria de haven looking lovelier than ever the film belongs to matthau and lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers 
884,i chuckled a few times during this movie i laughed out loud during the notarizing of the margarine company handover pun intended there are three segments in this movie the first one is supposed to be a spoof of woman grows up and launches career movies the tampax box was the funniest thing in this segment most of the cast members aren t listed here on imdb they are the lucky ones few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers the second segment is a spoof of sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry movies robert culp has several funny moments all physical humor including the aforementioned handover after his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as dominique corsaire rises higher and higher by the time she becomes first lady i wanted to rip the cable out of the tv and watch snow i switched to pakistani music videos instead i don t understand urdu or whatever language the videos were in it was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull story then came municipalians with the big stars half of them on screen for less than a minute elisha cook jr christopher lloyd rhea perlman henny youngman julie kavner richard widmark and robby benson it s supposed to be a spoof of young cop teams with hardened substance abusing older cop who needs retirement badly movies the horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive it was interesting seeing old rtd buses and a shell gas station sign and an american savings sign none of them are around anymore nagurski s never stop anywhere you might have to get out the car made me smile momentarily then they discuss how boring the young cop is a lot back and forth about how boring he is that was as boring as this description of how boring it is nagurski s law number four never go into a music store that s been cut into with an acetylene torch made me think that the music store is a real business at the actual location the dispatcher gave thinking about that was more interesting than the set up for the gag which followed young falcone benson gets shot a lot he becomes a hardened cop like nagurski the segment keeps going on and on and on it won t stop it rolls relentlessly onward no matter how many times you wish he d just die already so this thing will end it doesn t it goes on and on and on then a buffy the vampire slayer episode which i ve seen four times already comes on thank god this abysmal movie ended while i went to get the mail 
242,paul rudnick jeffrey addams family values wrote this frothy tale of a mild mannered school teacher kevin kline who is outted on the academy awards by a former student turned actor matt dillon the rest of the film deals with the absurdities revolving around this setup the effect on the town his fiancee joan cusack himself and climaxes with an everybody loves everybody finale if you re an angry gay rights activist or a naive youth looking for an accurate portrayal of a man s struggle to come out or a true depiction of gay life then save yourself the trouble and rent something else maybe beautiful thing or read a book giovanni s room if you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the piousness of tom hanks s speech on the academy awards when he won for philadelphia and pokes fun at hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a fondness for 30 s screwball comedy bringing up baby holiday the palm beach story then enjoy far from being a biting satire the film tries for the exuberance of a preston sturges farce and comes damn close no it s not deep or powerful neither were romy michelle 9 to 5 or young frankenstein and it doesn t pretend to be it keeps it s tongue firmly in cheek it gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good toward the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit stale there s also a locker room scene that could have been cut but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire it s like a breath of fresh air kevin kline and tom selleck are wonderfully game while debbie reynolds and wilford brimley add fine support the excellent joan cusack s award winning performance is stellar and the great bob newhart is well bob newhart the fact that many have been offended by in out is as absurd as the mentality of the townsfolk it pokes fun at personally i was more offended by philadelphia i ll take harmless fluff over sanctimoniousness anytime 
380,i bought this rental return for 1 99 at hollywood and overpaid i didn t expect much but thought it would be something to fall asleep by at least i quickly noted the very weak storyline the gross overacting by everyone no one talks like that except in cartoons and the seemingly let s make it up as we go along direction i know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed by it and i feel certain that it did not help any careers as for this movie buff of 35 years it has now provided a ready answer for the worst film you ve ever seen question 
117,there s no romance or other side plot to this movie it s action and intrigue all the way making it a real man s kung fu movie an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who s styles represents five venomous animals centipede snake scorpion lizard and the toad despite the word venom in the title none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents yan tieh told by his teacher that he s no match for the five former pupil must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story with good kung fu action spread out throughout the story recognized as a cult classic this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung fu action movies it s known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story it s no artistic masterpiece with the usual bad dubbing and corny acting but the movie is one of the best of its kind because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung fu action movie of its time and gives an extra concentrated dose of them one movie you must watch if you are a kung fu movie fan 
377,i usually like these dumb no brain activity movies but this was just too stupid there were way too many clichés and the plot didn t really make much sense there were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt we didn t even get too see if the big master plan worked we only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther the professor that died because of stupidity see below one scene annoyed me particularly why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam and if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes worth of oxygen why didn t he bring two or three of them then he would have survived that was bloody stupid the movie is pretty full of such stupid things i can not recommend it at all 
782,when a man who doesn t have alzheimer s can t remember how many films he s made he probably is the world s most prolific director after all that man is jesus franco the king of so called eurotrash his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed opaque stupid lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word the film s title is misleading for starters as any other franco film i ve seen that makes it sound pretty awful and it is yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility a generous way with the baldly outrageous with nudity and sleaze and violence and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out even while you re mostly waiting for them to end because they re so very tedious devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america there s lots of naked writhing dancing and endless repeated zoom ins on an ugly totem pole you need to get used to the repetitive zoom ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away as these are franco s main methods of extending a film out to feature length the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning apparently recorded in an echo chamber early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree and it s hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach or her genitals sweet jesus anyway the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers the flakey guy has an accent which as dubbed is half brooklyn american half english liverpudlian and all retarded all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest not too much really happens from here on in and it happens pretty sluggishly studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape the nebulous action is fleshed out haha by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads and even from the monster himself that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero but it s gotta be done at some point and it s nice to note that the director will show anyone s genitals on camera the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film making but he doesn t muck around with sets you get real islands jungles helicopters and mountains all in widescreen this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam ultimately issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot if you re trying to see all the video nasties you will have to watch this at some point and you ll be made as restless as i was if you like franco you ll watch this anyway if you fall into neither of the above categories the odds are you ll never come across this film copies of it aren t just lying around and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it it s franco lazy crazy franco 
40,steve martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy he absolutely does not fit this part like the woeful remake of the out of towners this movie falls flat on it s face how anybody ever thought steve martin could even come close to jack lemmon s wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie dan ackroyd could have played the bilko part better martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people s classic work it s a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over the line the producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the united states army was just about the only line that actually made me laugh if you want to see the real bilko get hold of the original episodes of the phil silvers show those are guaranteed to make you laugh unlike this mistake that should never have happened i put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned lemmon classic and the remake of psycho none of them should ever have happened 
838,one of the finest movies i have viewed good script original plot of a man who is haunted about jfk s assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that cold november day in 1963 thirty years later another anti social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president the secret service agent loses his partner along the way to the crazed gunmen who schemes lies and murders anybody in his path who ll stand in his way of his mission the movie accompanies with a great memorable score and a restrained but meaningful romance between russo and eastwood which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work malchovich is great sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played but how many could acted with such craftiness and intellect that he displayed in the movie needless to say i thought this was a great movie everytime it s on television i have to watch it and i own it on dvd i m a big eastwood fan this only boosted his already fabulous career and malchovich s best role to date 
764,like freddy s revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn t go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy i ve not alot to say about this it s moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series 
42,stardust another guarded review originally written june 15 2007 the marketing machine has only just begun for this one no site yet wth so i doubt most of you have heard about it in truth i hadn t either sort of when i got the posting i thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers one of the movies i want to see when not working so i an enjoy it 100 as a mere mortal movie goer turns out it wasn t transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as that neil gaiman movie what is it about well in short it s a gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star any more than that and i d be giving away plot info which is a a breach of contract and b spoiling your fun if you really want to know what it s about go buy the book rumour has it gaiman might be something of a writer not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile and for this one it certainly was this screening was special in that it included not just film critics but also exhibitors they rarely have a mixed screening and local sci fi fantasy folks so you know the expected audience right i mean with this crowd and the title of stardust i knew what to expect oh how sweetly wrong i was yes it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom but it was not lord of rings it was not even another lord of the rings wannabe ahem eragon it was much more intimate than all that but like lord of the rings it was the well humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities it s surely a romantic tale but with generous splashes of humour and that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick shrekism it s more along the lines of dramedy than comedy before i go on let s do this movie review thing acting is in the very least good it s always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles michelle pfieffer is not sadly one of those she plays a villain and she does the job nothing special rupert everett though he was a real jerk that is a great villain peter o toole is well peter frickin o toole which is marvelous ricky gervais is perfectly cast and shows why robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part when he wanted to deliver the goods though he did and charlie cox who as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i ain t never heard of claire danes claire danes claire danes i ve always been of mixed opinion with her she can be great and then she can seem to miss the mark in this she s the former and she is quite literally the star of this film sure her accent stumbles here and there and yes she s not as good as she can be when cox isn t in the scene however well see for yourself special effects are muted yet accomplished and only significant where they should be best flying ship yet sorry potter direction is light hearted and flows nicely cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand all else is top bracket and now that that s done the writing oh the writing neil you devil it s hard in today s climate to do anything original and at first you begin to wonder a kingdom a dying king a boy out to prove his own worth witches ghosts a quest or three what s new but gaiman s story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart and though you suspect how it s all going to turn out you begin to wonder in the third act and if you re me find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best in the end you ll find this story this movie is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not fantastical and real i wish i could talk about septimus vs tristan but i won t ruin it for you for those who read the book rest assured it s done properly those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new withheld for this generation the blank gets filled in only after the movie is in wide release because well you might be expecting it you ll know when you walk out anyway i sincerely hope stardust doesn t get lost among the tentpoles even if it does it ll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i know forgot to add the withheld reveal i m a few years late but a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new the princess bride for this generation perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but i m still confident that years form now there will be the same oh i love that movie response to this as there is now for the princess bride 
552,let me start off by saying that this doesn t seem or feel like a movie it seems like just another tv show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up the camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it this film takes us to where no movie i ve seen has done before to a realm where the film theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation too obvious the large movie screen is only used as an enlarged tv from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner lately it seems that young directors are compromising the art of film making for sales this is very scary the industry is spoiling the art in movies we must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about not just sales and entertainment but a way to communicate feelings passions and even culture not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks 
799,i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead i only saw one other play in the 1970 s 1990 s that had an emotional impact like this play did i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn t reprise her role in the film she wasn t well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy spacek instead sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way i love anne bancroft but she seemed too young for this role the movie plot was true to the play anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind 
815,bobby and mikey are two little boys who move across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life soon after the family settles in their mom marries the king who ends up being an abusive stepfather especially to bobby so bobby decides that he will fly away from the abuse in his birthday present this movie was difficult to watch especially the abuse scenes it was hard to watch an innocent playful little boy become abused and turn into a sullen scared and withdrawn young man the acting is excellent i cried throughout the last half of the movie there were some funny scenes in it too like the monster brew and the dog that finds the pop bottles i wouldn t suggest letting little kids watch it it was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really really flew away 
240,top gun without the in house animosity or class or money or cruise an excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of next big thing actors to market their ability to lead a matinée this doesn t really have anything anyone can get their teeth into it s a shame because the opening shot of charlie sheen opens out with great promise which is squandered almost straight away with a preposterous wedding set piece barking dennis haysbert is a changeable actor for me but in this film he is fine particularly the action sequences michael biehn is a first class action hero but not a leading man charlie sheen is to all intents and purposes the leading man but never quite an action hero there s a stunt cast of hundreds who are also mentionworthy 3 10
156,oh cgi a blessing when used properly a sin with it s used by people who have no idea what their doing sadly that s not the only thing that s used poorly in this umpteen jaws rip off ok anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things 1 i like low budget horror movies and 2 if there is a cute guy in said low budget movie i ll usually point them out so let s just get this out of the way right now this is one low budget horror movie i didn t like the acting for the most part is horrible effects laughable and the script rivals battlefield earth as the worst i ve witnessed this year as far as the resident cute boy dax miller bog wins that prize hands down this boy is hot and surprisingly he s not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt he can actually act well as much as he can in this odious film now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way let s get on with it in cliff notes version here s the story don t worry i ll try not to give anything away a film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers established cute boy and his buddy who surf with sharks unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island croc shows up mayhem ensues and people are eaten roll end credits as i said earlier this film pretty much blows it started pretty well but soon devolved into being silly and stupid a main character becomes lunch in a rather humorous way and our remaining heros utter one liners at the victims expense also if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water what s with all the sharks around if this thing can eat a 40 foot boat i don t think a few skimpy sharks would stick around the fx is some of the worst i have ever had the displeasure to see the cgi is horrendous and they ve even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs attention filmmakers national geographic discovery store the croc hunter they know what crocodiles look like you obviously didn t reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film and what s with the pirate drug pusher gang did you just need another reason to rip off a woman s top it s funny how we get little sub genres in the movie world with alligator and it s sequels lake placid crocodile and now blood surf it now looks like over sized crocodile alligator movies should now get their own category at blockbuster alligator was good lake placid was good i even thought tobe hooper s crocodile was good blood surf sucked my grade d 
669,i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall i liked it it showed great potential i guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together by the filmmaker s own admission on the official site the short was exhibited as a rough cut but nonetheless it was an easy going comedy i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy all they are supposed to do is make you laugh that s all i did just that at its showing so it succeeded on that level just my 2 cents anyway 
286,annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy i would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasn t for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role and it s too bad for hamill that he didn t take a few acting lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo 
316,recap a lone swordsman living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen recollects how his life turned out to be as it is it started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead causing him to leave his home town one of the swordsmen is huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister but the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have huang protected and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person comments i ve seen the redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994 how the two versions differ i can t say but the redux is very heavily stylized in the way of chinese wuxia action that is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie a comprehensible story but true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director kar wai wong therefore there are lots of colorful very beautiful scenes that are completely unrelated to the story the editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled much is left out in the scenes the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated the result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie thanks to these brutal but very few fights the movie is put into the action genre the poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action the other couldn t be farther away from it the movie in its entirety is very slow dull and hence very boring not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie i might say that i m not a fan of this chinese style since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems most importantly that the visual is more important than the story but ashes of time redux is perhaps the worst example i ve seen 3 10
984,bad news for anyone wanting to film a full length parody of a lifetime network movie the makers of a deadly encounter have already done it albeit unintentionally all of the lifetime tropes are there a divorced mother in peril from a deranged stalker an unreliable ex husband who of course cheated on her while they were married and a police department that patronizingly dismisses her complaints forcing her to stand up for herself especially jaw dropping is the scene where the heroine after enduring a break in and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker decides to relieve the stress by going shopping having seen first hand the harassment of a co worker by some creep she met at church i know stalking is not a joke but it certainly is in this movie 
564,rowan atkinson s mr bean ranks right up there with laurel hardy buster keaton the marx brothers and other comedy greats i have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when i introduced them to mr bean via my videos and now dvds i ll never forget the first time my brother saw him he was over for a visit and i asked him if he d ever seen mr bean who he said so i got out my video and showed him the one where mr bean is in church and starts to nod off my brother laughed so hard he fell out of the chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard he became an instant fan of mr bean we all know how hilarious these episodes are but the fun is in sharing them with others i have seen so many people laugh til it hurts favorite episodes are the visit of the queen the hotel room stay late for the dentist appointment the christmas episode a classic plus kids love it and the new year party rowan atkinson is a comic genius 
215,this movie came and went in the theaters due to the nature of it you can see why it wasn t well received it was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself higher learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in america racism plot story higher learning is mostly centered around malik played by omar epps a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough and a stern professor played by laurence fishburne he befriends fudge ice cube as well as a gorgeous lady named deja tyra banks later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus remy play by michael rapaport is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus once they impose their views on him he becomes as racist as they are opinion higher learning is not without its flaws character development is scarce okay performances by omar epps tyra banks and the leader of the skinheads whose name i forgot busta rhymes doesn t fit in this movie at all plus women turning gay after being abused by men was cliché before this film so you know i didn t like that part of the film with kristy swanson other than that this movie wasn t half bad laurence fishburne was good as professor phipps even though i could do without the accent fudge was ice cube s best performance and michael rapaport was good as the confused remy all in all it was one of john singleton s best movies and is one is one of the reasons i frown on the rubbish he puts out now cinema needs more movies like higher learning mississippi burning and american history x and less movies like baby boy 2 fast 2 furious and a very pointless remake of shaft 
135, red sonja is flawed weak and lacking even the camp ness isn t good there are only two good things about red sonja the costumes even though the red sonja costume is ridiculous it s ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men because she was raped still choose to wear so few little clothes even when it rains and the music by ennio morricone still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable the story is extremely simple and they didn t even bother to make it interesting the story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways the movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely brigitte nielsen is an horrible leading lady i don t know who s accent is worse hers or arnie s and on top of that she can t act there is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable even worse was sandahl bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag ronald lacey was somewhat good in his role but my god he looked horrible he changed so much since his only well known role in raiders of the lost ark maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991 and by the way what was with all those raiders of the lost ark actors in this movie next to ronald lacey pat roach terry richards and tutte lemkow appeared in a role it seemed like some kind of raiders of the lost ark reunion the only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the sword fights even though some of them are needless and weak only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy genre 4 10

5,one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance adventure holywood movies as if those weren t reason enough to love it anyone who after seeing this movie complains about connery s accent or the lack of historical verisimilitude or the realism of the political motivations or any other extra movie concerns simply doesn t love movies see it and be awed by the star power of the two leads the exotic romantic photography and music and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film this is proof that hollywood can make em like they used to when it really wants to a solid 8 10 
294,lights of new york was the first all talking feature film there had been of course the jazz singer released in oct 1927 as the first feature film incorporating synchronized dialog however this film released in july 1928 is virtually unremembered for its place in film history it had started out as a short but gradually more was tacked on until clocking in at 58 minutes it accidentally became the first all talking feature film it opened to a grind house run and to warner bros surprise made over a million dollars that was good money back in 1928 the plot is quite simple two country barbers naively buy into a barber shop on broadway that fronts as a speak easy for the hawk a gangster when they learn the truth they can t afford to get out because the younger barber eddie has all of his mother s money tied up in the place kitty is the younger barber s girlfriend and gangster hawk wheeler oakman has an eye for turning in his older girlfriend gladys brockwell for a newer model chorus girl kitty helene costello a cop is killed while trying to stop the hawk s men from unloading a shipment of bootleg liquor and the hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame eddie thus getting kitty for himself this early talkie is loads of fun for the enthusiast of these pioneering works sure the plot is elementary and the dialog stilted but there is something you don t see much of in early talkies background musical scoring vitaphone had originally been used for this very purpose and here they are still using it for musical accompaniment along with the dialog and there are singing and dancing numbers the scenes in hawk s nightclub are used as an opportunity to show off what films could never do before musical numbers there is even a wild eyed emcee with some heavy makeup left over from the silent era that is a hoot to watch vitaphone could not go outdoors at this point due to the static camera booths so the scene in the park between the two lovers eddie and kitty is simulated and cheaply the greenery looks like something out of an ed wood movie or perhaps a high school production of our town gladys brockwell as the hawk s castoff girlfriend delivers her lines with punch she s a real trooper considering what lines she has to deliver to the hawk so you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck huh mixed metaphors anyone and then there are her final lines i ve lived and i ve loved and i ve lost did someone get paid to write this dialog brockwell was making a good success of her talkie career after scoring some triumphs in silent films the evil sister in seventh heaven when a fatal car accident cut her career short then there is eugene palette the older of the two barbers in our story his frog voice natural delivery of lines and cuddly appearance gave him a long career as a character actor usually appearing as a put upon family man businessman with a gruff exterior and heart of gold in fact mr palette is the only member of this cast who still has a notable career in films just three years after this movie is released finally there is the question of where is that microphone hidden microphones were still stationary at this point and it s fun to figure out where they ve hidden it there is one famous scene though where everybody can pretty much figure it out hawk is in his office talking to his two henchman who seem to comprehend as slowly as they talk about taking eddie for a ride if you watch this scene you d swear the phone on the desk is a character in this film it s front and center during the whole conversation the microphone is likely planted in the phone there is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind in the face of the new technology of sound you have silent actors who are accustomed to using pantomime for expression vaudevillians who know how to play to a live audience but don t know how to make the same impression on a vitaphone camera booth and you have dialog writers either trying to write conversation as compactly as they did title cards or filling up films with endless chatter check this one out it is not boring moves fast and is loads of fun if you know what to look for and no i don t expect this one to ever be out on blu ray but i hope that the folks at warner brothers add it to the warner archive soon so everyone can see it 
245,this is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on this movie is practically mchale s navy for the 90s or police academy at sea grammer proves he can play roles other than frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the navy in order to get his own sub rob schneider is as wormy as usual the same in every role he plays and lauren holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain ken hudson campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase the movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non predictable script that still surprises me every time i watch it many of the navy phrases and terms go over my head though but it s a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters 
646,who doesn t love the muppets impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside so i guess what s important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special i don t remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film i recall quite fondly in fact there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self conscious in any bad way refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique the magic transcends all that other stuff tis indeed what movies are made of so how does the film achieve these things hmmm nice question stumped am i let s see really i feel like it s quite simple the filmmakers believe in their material and don t take themselves too seriously in the process i probably wouldn t say the film has many truly inspired moments but it does have a certain life to it that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack a zest you really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures they also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing generally i get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren t afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session lots of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through the cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance maybe i don t feel i have much to say about it because i was half asleep when i saw it and or as i write this review anyway i m sort of semi repeating myself here but i really liked the sense of family the movie had full of love i suppose you might say again a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly and to repeat myself once more one of the film s best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere like the nathaniel hawthorne quote about happiness being like a butterfly so the muppet movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that anyway if that sounds sappy i also reckon it was pretty hilarious so all in all this movie was very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to plus it features lots of great music highly recommended to all humans both the young and the young at heart 
436,on broadway a chorus line was pure magic from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show we were totally engaged captivated by the intensely personal stories some funny some clever some stirring of this chorus line the movie is another matter entirely the focus is now on the director and what an ogre he is every time the film switches to michael douglas there he is with a bitter sour expression barking out questions and orders screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance yikes that changes the dynamics of the story on broadway the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong fragile intriguing hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity there is a reason this work won the pulitzer prize and actually in one of the only moments the director appears he is there to comfort the young puerto rican dancer after we hear that dancer s heart breaking story he appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection concern for cassie but in the movie from the second douglas director starts bitterly barking orders the chorus line members stories become secondary it s like they are in a lousy profession where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show is jaded exhausted furious at having to audition these chorus members on stage there was always the excitement of the show here in the movie practically from the word go you feel sorry for everyone involved during the course of the musical we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job but of course that couldn t happen but in the finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage sometimes reflecting us in the audience in our hearts and we know also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much bringing magic to the theatre in the movie after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis that magic becomes totally diluted all we feel even with the exact same curtain call is that some of the members got a job with a mean spirited director so they all come on the screen and are dancing again big deal 
429,it really impresses me that it got made the director writer actor must be really charismatic in reality i can think of no other way itd pass script stage what i want you to consider is this while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there not enjoying it just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying id really like to know what the budget is guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor i want to write the jokes didn t appeal to me but the reality is for them to appeal to you you d have to be the man who wrote them or a retard so imagine that in script form and this guy got that green lit thats impressive isn t it 
936,nothing is worse than the genocides of our world s history this film attempts to describe the horror faced by one particular family a common narrative device in the atomic bomb world of hiroshima the most memorable parts are the graphic and saddening images that the people of hiroshima face in the aftermath of war the story however becomes more concerned with the effect on a specific group of people and how they cope with getting on with their lives in other words if you don t really care about them the film grows boring it s hard not to care though when a family s homeland is wrecked i m not sure if i would recommend this film because it says very little politically and honestly did not keep my interest in the family s troubles 
315,this is a stereotype plot a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight the fights are not of high standards they are way too simple in a way that 1 1 is simple to every adult the fighter has trained and enters the ring but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking the coach yells do this and do that with no success and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once this results in a turning point in the fight although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point think about the rocky movies and you ll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes the fights are also shot poorly there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment these guys really could have made some quality entertainment but the director wasn t up to the task or the other crew in my opinion maybe they had a small budget i don t know but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10 
728,i wrote an essay in 1981 the year i graduated high school called the last american virgin i also had a friend named nancy who was the prostitute in this film apparently her daughter got a hold of my essay one night when she slept over my house a year later i wake up one morning and see the advertisement for this film i was 18 years old based the essay on experiences in my life the film is a bit different from my essay but definitely taken from it i did not have any proof of this matter except my english teacher mr versace who gave me an a on my essay i let it go never did anything about it i figured what comes around goes around i still would not take any action against anyone involved in this film i just needed to get it off my chest as i really never told anyone about it except my closest friend they agreed to keep it a secret the same year it came out i saw nancy in a market she actually had the nerve to ask me if i had any good stories or scripts for her to look at i guess thats what hollywood is all about getting stories from wherever you can it was interesting seeing parts of my life on the big screen though ghost writer 
483,where to begin how best to describe just how awful this movie is let s start with the campy hick humor it isn t very funny add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse pity poor art carney who should have known better than to do this movie and then there is the plot a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper at least they get what they want and then just when the movie should end they can t come up with a more plausible last scene than a well i won t ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a b movie or perhaps worse gailard sartain is one of them for me and he has a more prominent role that s a sure sign that the movie probably won t be very good if nothing else the movie lives up to the low expectations even exceeds them by being worse than poor let s just say this this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared and none are worse than roadie 
655,one word supurrrrb i don t think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring re runs i have to say i had my reservations after all critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show but when half an hour was over by the way thank you nbc for running a commercial free show i was left with the feeling of instant love love at first glance the true love that one feels in his guts everything about this show screamed excellence graphics in this show were at least as good as finding nemo and shrek no small feat considering those movies took years to be developed cast was marvelous i am partial to john goodman s voice but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john special mention lisa kudrow s guest appearance she was on top of the game creating neurotic pudgy and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her panda from brooklyn only in this show script was funny with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp yet not tacky a note for all parents this is not for children this show was never advertised as such and there s a reason why it s set for 9pm not 8pm so if you d like to complain about objectionable context save your breath adults deserve a comedy made just for them and father of the pride is it not everything was perfect i was a bit puzzled by siegfried and roy s characters do i sense stereotype when it comes to them yes they are gay yes they are flamboyant yes they speak with german accents but that s yesterday s news give us something new something fresh something funny putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the star power that these guys have that s fine by me but please don t dwell on something everybody already knows by heart hopefully the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over in general the show is definitely a must see tv funny witty with a few unexpected twists here and there there haven t been a comedy this good since seinfeld i am certainly looking forward to the next episode 
888,this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward furlong terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago i ve watched it at least 20 times the plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines on the plus side it s the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldn t believe how terrible the movie was i think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies 
270,well i generally like iranian movies and after having seen 10 by kiarostami the night before i was expecting a great movie i was very disappointed this is by far the worst iranian film and one of the most boring asian movies i have ever seen if you have never seen a kiarostami movie before watch ten instead if you want some good iranian movies you may also try sib aka the apple this movie is divided in 5 parts and only the fourth featuring some funny ducks is worth watching if this is the first iranian movie you see you probably won t want to see any more i don t blame you but you will miss some great movies 
57,some of the best movies that are categorized as comedies actually blur between comedy and drama the graduate and butch cassidy and the sundance kid which were made also in the late 1960 s are perfect examples are they comedies with dramatic undertones or dramas with a lot of humor in many respects the odd couple falls into this same category of being both comedy yet highly dramatic with deep underpinnings about human nature much of what happens may be funny to the audience but the characters are not laughing despite the rather light hearted tv show of the 1970 s the original odd couple is not merely about a neat guy and messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital situation it s really about two opposites who must face why their marriages fell apart and how their detrimental idiosyncrasies reveal themselves outside of their marriage neatness the characteristic of felix ungar jack lemon perfectly cast and messiness the characteristic of oscar madison walter matthau are only the beginning and somewhat superficial as the story unfolds we find there is a lot more to these men than simply neatness versus messiness briefly the story is really about felix ungar who has to face an impending divorce from his wife francis who we never meet but is an important character throughout the story on the verge of suicide ungar goes to the only place he knows the apartment of oscar madison where a group of poker buddies hang out every so often we learn that ungar is not only a member of this poker club but the group knows what s happening to him and try in their inept way to help out madison figures the best way to help ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies wear off unfortunately for madison he doesn t know what he s getting himself into madison is a carefree happy go lucky if rather irresponsible slob who s refrigerator was last cleaned probably when herbert hoover was still in the white house madison s idea of serving snacks is grabbing moldy cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread and then throwing the contents of a bag of chips on the table on the other hand he enjoys booze and women in short having a good time ungar is not only altogether different he is diametrically opposite he is not only an obsessive neatness nut that finds more joy in disinfecting the apartment than meeting women but he knows more than most women do about cooking and fine eating at one point he calls his ex wife not to talk about reconciling but to get her recipe for meatloaf at another moment ungar was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting cabbage for coleslaw when madison seems unimpressed ungar finally confesses he was only doing it for his roommate because he can t stand coleslaw who is this guy but he has another endearing trait felix is also a hypochondriac he obsesses about his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places claiming he s helping his sinuses he seems to have every health condition in the book and if they made up more felix would probably have them ultimately he is overly self absorbed running throughout the movie are references to marriage at one point when madison is trying to convince ungar to move in he says what do you want a wedding ring but little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can t deal with the messy guy but the other way around their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship and the climax occurs when oscar invites two lonely british sisters for a get together with both comedic and tragic results this is one of the best comedies of its type ever written and not to be missed with superlative performances by walter matthau and jack lemon in roles that are hard to imagine better played by anyone else it is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today 
251,this show has come so far at first everyone in the cast from eric to fez they were all new actors and actresses fresh faces and just look what they accomplished they stuck with the show and it was a success its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom i ve ever seen in my life it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show i hope to god that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had i don t care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode go down swinging get one last punch in the show deserves it the fans deserve it if they go let everyone know its going to end like on friends and let the finale be huge i say get donna and eric married i say have hyde and kelso fight and become friends again i say have something interesting happen between fez and jackie because fez has been trying for so long but of course it wont work out for him just close out the series big time guys that 70s show will always be the best in my eyes eric kelso donna jackie fez hyde i wish i had you guys as friends you are the best 10 10 
830, sky captain and the world of tomorrow an amazingly incovenient title is simply a bad movie it has no heart no deep ideas nothing very special about it yes the cgi backgrounds look interesting but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus additionally the movie uses music the same way as say gilligan s island or the scooby doo cartoons it never stops terribly simply terrible there are no fresh ideas either just gobs and gobs and gobs and etc of bits taken from older movies and serials there is no gatekeeper here the movie just seems to exist because it can save your money and your time not entertaining at all 
317,the first time i saw this film i was in shock for days afterwards its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention helped by good acting and some really intriguing music the ending quite simply had me gasping first rate 
962,until today i thought there only three people including me who considered heaven s gate 1980 to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western since the 1970 after little big man 1970 jeremiah johnson 1972 the outlaw josey wales 1976 and the long riders 1980 i was stunned and pleased to see that 22 5 of those voting at imdb rate this movie a 10 as do i a recent book the worst movies of all time includes heaven s gate through it s production and release it was vilified as no movie since cleopatra almost twenty years before at one time it was considered the most expensive over budget movie of all time surpassing even cleopatra it was blamed for the downfall of its studio united artists until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling michael cimino fresh from his glory with the deer hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess but clearly that was petty jealousy at its worst cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the american experience this film is not to be missed but any serious student of american filmmaking 
110,silly hilarious tragic sad inevitable a group of down and outs team up with a seasoned crook to elevate themselves out of their poverty great idea if you ignore the screwup factor nice to see george clooney doing something genuinely funny for a change the casting is perfect and the acting standards very high although it could be said that the motley crew subject isn t new i think this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way sufficiently so that it stands out from what has gone before very well done guys 
239,the story line has been rehashed a number of times a breath of life in the retirement home several plays movies novels short stories poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end but it s still an excellent platform for character studies if gideon was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches even the subtitle and summary of gideon s simple wisdom almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors lack of focus almost irrelevant 
300,i admit that i am a vampire addict i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten i was very impressed by the original john carpenter s vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first and it is not quite so dark but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else 
573,i ve watched almost all of the gundam mech anime that have showed in the us and this by far has the best story the way its plot twists and turns has u riveted gundam wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war the series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as gundams the gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as oz as things begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilots new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate old conflicts will end and new ones will arise to obtain peace the gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting but how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal i recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot 
162,this is one of my favorite films for many reasons to begin there are standout performances from lovely debra paget as a princess dancing girl from michael rennie as the villain handsome young jeffrey hunter investigating crime in her city state and others the film is an unusually colorful adventure and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she later performs for once she manages to skewer hunter before she learns he is on her side also the photography the costumes by travilla lionel newman s music and the film s style are unusually fine add to this rousing action intelligent characterization and fine direction by veteran harmon jones of a gerald drayson adams script set in 1249 ad and you have the ingredients of an enjoyable grecianized near eastern but there is much to praise about the unusual and well developed storyline here as there is much more to praise other than the film s swift pace well managed physical action sequences and superior technical aspects classically trained actors such as michael ansara edgar barrier wally cassell jack elam and dona drake are not commonly found in one b film together nor are there fascinating sets a variety of locales and a mystery of the quality that is supplied here one way of assessing a film is if i were guaranteed to live through the experience would i choose to undergo these events and perform these actions since my answer is a resounding yes in this case this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and very underrated cinematic work could it be that us critics all too frequent disdain for females as warriors and thinkers that as in so many other cases has caused closed minds to misprize this estimable film s obvious anti tyranny and pro entertainment qualities 
466,this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in abbott and costello meet frankentstein it was a somewhat desparate yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man frankenstein s monster and dracula one last time i say desparate because in the previous film house of frankenstein both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be dracula by the sunlight and the wolf man by a silver bullet yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn t be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein and if the wolf man didn t get cured then there d be no plot holes but since this is not the case the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense however ignoring these plot holes house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that s fun to watch it has many high points especially seeing the wolf man get cured i know i just said that this shouldn t have been included but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time and the scene with the lady playing moonlight senada on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under dracula s spell was very eerie dr edleman s transformation into the dr jekyl mr hyde type character was also done very well and it s great to see dracula frankenstein and the wolf man together one last time out of 
174,a movie this dumb should never see the light of day the acting is lame the violence is just all over the place the sneaking ending is just plain stupid it s all about a lawyer who saw a murder done by the r i c c o squad no one has never seen him not even the hit men themselves so he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this r i c c o squad before they find them then the movie goes on to a romance gun shooting and voodoo now how in the hell did voodoo come in this never see this film if your life depends on it trust me 
153,i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself am i going crazy can t i see the beauty from a film like this am i just dumb enough to not understand the message this film is trying to point out i don t know maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well the film idea was going nowhere i was sure it would have a foggy end and of course it did nothing exceptional not even the landscapes i hopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice but no just a lame story about a crazy teacher and of course her crazy students now all grown up each of them with his her own fixed ideas and boy some of those ideas were stupid like the lizard story for example at a moment i thought i was watching x files with the lizard entering in the ear and all no from my point of view this movie is a waste of time not to say money if u pay for the ticket the only part that i did like was the acting of the young blue eye german kid he played very well and convincing for his age the rest nothing i read the previous review and i think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film i think to myself again maybe i am the crazy one advice don t waste your time with this 
175,publicity got me to the theatreadvice will take you away from this waist of time very bad everything do you really want to see a monkey talking with a technological device x
172,this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now family and friends feel the same way about it this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive shahid kapoor and amrita rao acted extremely well in this also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies this is a must see movie it s a family and romantic movie this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon this movie is their best right now the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction this movie is must see recommended to everyone 
672,the forest isn t just your everyday standard slasher backwoods cannibal fare it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well the story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip a cave dwelling cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them there is something you don t see every slasher director don jones gets an a for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level the acting is just simply average except for jeanette kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman michael brody aka gary kent the film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest they realize too late that someone is stalking them they are both dispatched in typical slasher fare our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife s lover the forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn t work along with it i found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting 4 10
989,two popular actors are paired in showtime like de niro and murphy playing a police and an actor although they share the most screen time together they do not reach their expected performances such films like analyse this meet the parents dr doolittle and nutty professor the film starts interestingly but becomes a thin ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing it feels like especially de niro doesn t enjoy being in showtime thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what i think unfortunately if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular hollywood movie well i don t think there would be a sequel to this at least casting de niro and murpy again out of 
755,i saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on hbo and i loved it it was so hilarious i have seen it too many times to count i love the stork brothers and the pitiful ugly dog bosco my favorite quote form the movie is it s so ugly it should be put to sleep i also loved it when the little sister slaps the girls on the back and their faces stick that way i love john cusack and demi moore in this movie too they were great this movie brings back memories of my college days when i first saw it i rented the movie countless times and watched it over and over my college roommate and i just couldn t get enough of it who couldn t love this crazy movie i want to buy a copy on dvd does anyone know where i can get it 
858,superhero movie 2008 is the most recent in the long line over parody movie movies which i despise so much i wish this movie could be the death of the genre but i know that it isn t awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin if meet the spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go than superhero movie is probably near the top unfortunately meet the spartans was actually miles below the barrel and this movie just barely makes it in superhero movie has a decent cast of c list celebs it s got drake bell the kid from disney s drake and josh leslie nielson airplane tracy morgan snl and 30 rock and a few others scattered throughout although it has the star power to light a 40 watt bulb the movie fails to utilize any humor this movie is about 80 minutes long most of which is dedicated to following the spiderman plot and not one single joke is funny i didn t laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire time don t see this movie don t even think about it for the love of cinema just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another one oh who am i kidding they ll probably come out with another one by fall 
52,i rented this movie the other day b c i love romance stories but this has got to be the worst one i have ever seen in my life i find it hard to believe that sam would fall in love with kelley after they ve said hardly no more than 2 words to each other when she has a great long time boyfriend who s devoted to her completely i thought kelley was a major jerk throughout the movie and he never changed at all the only good thing about the movie was josh hartnett i thought he did a wonderful acting job and i m going to start watching more movies of his 
649,budget decent actors who knew these things were important don t waste your time on this piece of junk the effects are crap the acting is crap the only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little cheap t a and that gets squandered in the first 20 minutes the only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity it was like they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never cursed before hats off if you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old prom photos the only way for a bigfoot flick to be any good is for it to have a big budget and some actors who didn t come from frogballs community theater 
22,so i got this from the rental store where i work before it was released release is 8 21 just watched it today and now i m speechless they could have had a decent movie here but they screwed it up in some painfully obvious ways first of all the parts with john krasinski were funny and are the only reason i gave it above a 3 but they are broken up by bad acting and terrible serious reflections on life between the main character andrew keegan and his girlfriend the annoying lacy chabert it would have been much much better as a straight comedy ala lock stock and two smoking barrels i wanted to like it because i think krasinski is funny and want to see him do well the story wasn t bad either just not very original but the directing and a lot of the acting was terrible i swear they had trouble keeping peoples faces in the shot and just went with it anyway their carelessness is showcased when the gun expert corrects another character and says that a dirty harry gun is not a 357 magnum but a 45 it was as everyone knows a 44 magnum so see this if you 1 really like john krasinski 2 like to watch low budget and poorly directed movies or 3 have too much time on your hands this is me 
501,this is a great ending to the show the fact that adm janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected thus infecting the queen with a poison that in essence ended the borg was great the way they ended it also left some not a lot for a reunion movie however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom and b lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today 
296,i was pleasantly surprised with this one it s actually quite interesting and engaging the cast is strong even dan cortese brooke shields has come into her own as an actress black and white must have really set her free cause i have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character if marketed right could be a medium size hit 
591,mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere at what looks like a wooden building in the desert a pick up truck pulls up an angry father chucks his slutty daughter virginia monroe claudia christian out leaves her there but she isn t alone as the shadowy figure of nestor duvalier brion james watches her from a short distance virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her leopard print thigh high high heeled boots nestor grabs her by her throat drags her off into the darkness nestor then rips her top open turns into a monster starts to eat her innards virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have lieutenant carlo hendrix art evans the lapd baffled or at least that s the message a local tv news reporter named clay dwyer mark thomas miller is telling his viewers clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend alice mary beth mcdonough therefore his mother emily jeanne bates has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the blind dark sunglass wearing nestor unfortunately for emily she accidentally knocks nestor s sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes nestor then turns into a monster again bites emily turning her into a flesh eating monster just like himself nestor takes emily out to train her they find a suitable homeless bum rory vansaint murder him eat his guts but emily s son clay has witnessed the whole thing he must choose between doing what is right his love for his mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking flesh eating monster edited written directed by patrick rand i thought mom was a pretty awful film looking at some of the other comments on the imdb the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that mom is a comedy horror well i can tell you now that i didn t see any comedic elements in mom at all because there aren t any unless they are very subtle the only thing that i can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which mom presents that being an old lady turning into a flesh eating monster the predictable problems emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out there are no jokes apart from naming a prostitute beverly hills stella stevens slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself as far as i could see it is played totally straight throughout it s 90 minute run time so with there being no comedy in mom that must mean there s lots of horror right wrong mom sucks is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of nestor turning into a monster a couple of times biting emily showing her how to hunt for food clay finding out until this point mom was moving at a fairly decent pace had some ok special make up effects had me interested unfortunately mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by emily s son the eventual breakdown of his marriage him being torn between love for his mother the fact that she s a flesh eating monster this part of the film is incredibly slow boring as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichéd role reversal scenario where clay tells his mom to go to her room stay there locking the door behind her telling her off putting bars over her window so she can t escape her room mom s script totally ignores the monsters origins ask s us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should no matter how silly an explanation might have been i think some background to the monster would have helped technically mom is bland cheap looking although i can t say it s badly made it s very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which i could make fun of to pass the time the special make up effect s on the monster are ok but their used in very quick flashes blink you ll miss them don t be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like i was the monster is only in it three times maximum all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes there isn t much gore either a severed arm some brief intestine eating a burnt body a drill in someone s arm is all we get the acting is ok but please mr brion james what is that dodgy accent all about at least james had the good sense to know he was in crap sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings everyone else are nobodies expect the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in fright night 1985 but you may recognise him from die hard 2 1990 he made mom die hard 2 in the same year talk about opposite ends of the spectrum overall there is nothing by which i can really recommend mom as a horror film it certainly isn t a comedy as far as i m concerned very poor very disappointing yet again i ve been conned by fancy video box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters definitely one to avoid 
768,i really liked zb1 really i did i have no problem with extremely low budget movies and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than zb3 if you can imagine such a thing check out wiseguys vs zombies if you re interested indeed i prefer lower budget zombie films because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are about but zb3 was just so bad it was retarded i don t want to bother being dignified in my criticism i want my 90 minutes back etc except that it really only took 80 minutes because partway through i put it into 1 4x fast forward okay here s some criticism 1 the pacing was terrible everyone talked in monologues even when someone just had a single line the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of f bombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue at first i was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to zb1 s 70 minutes but there were actually fewer events in zb3 it s all talking 2 the gore effects got stupider just glop rubbed around on people s tummies 3 despite the epic exposition there really wasn t a plot and the exposition is indeed epic i won t spoil it if you re going to watch it don t watch it but then it s just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for 80 minutes or fewer if you so choose 
379,this was painful recently given away as a free dvd with a british newspaper this british belgian co production from 1977 could ve fooled me it looks ten years older than that at least is quite deservedly obscure and if you make it past the half hour mark consider yourself a trouper the combining of animation and live action is ropey at best and downright dreadful at worst which makes you wonder why it was decided to even attempt making the film in this manner when clearly the technology wasn t really there harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless i ve seen with the obligatory trippy moments especially where the animation of the brainiac type subtracto character is involved that rendered countless cartoon features from the late sixties onward instantly dated the screenplay by don black provides a convincing argument for the usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored as for adults stick to jonathan swift s original novel 
190,tries to be funny and fails miserably the animation is just terrible looks like a 2 year old threw it together in his sleep plot is dull and cliched if you have a young child maybe rent it but don t waste hard earned money to pay to see it 1 10
313,the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show but as a movie it doesn t work in the same way don t get me wrong this is a very funny movie full of biting witty dialogue that caricatures the modern british chav wonderfully well whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious if unrealistic story one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant or it s embarrassing to watch when i say embarrassing i don t mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras but rather you ll wish they hadn t included it in the final cut one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended to the tune of this is how we do it whenever i watch the film i stop the dvd when it says the end and leave it at that overall ali g indahouse is a good film worth watching a couple of times the script is enjoyable to an extent and there are no issues as far as acting goes however refinement is the key word here ali g is a better television programme borat is a better film 
151,in luchino visconti s film death in venice it is not only the beauty in the surrounding world that decays but in the pursuit of beauty itself gustav von aschenbach decays into a mere shell of a man to understand the decay we must acknowledge the beauty which enchants us it is best described and explained in a quote from socrates found in thomas mann s version of death in venice beauty alone is lovely and visible at once it is the sole aspect of the spiritual which we can perceive through our senses else what if the divine if reason and virtue and truth were to speak to us through the senses should we not perish and become consumed by love we see in the film this very thing happen the man becomes enveloped by a longing for beauty which turns into a longing for the boy tadzio even though the levelheaded part of his mind tells him that adoration of beauty can lead to sensuousness and abandon he cannot contain himself it would be easy to describe this as a beautiful film early on we see the extravagance of the parlor and we are treated to a perfect summarization of turn of the century upper class life all captured on film perfectly by cinematographer pasqualino de santis but visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of venice instead the glorious and sensuous artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensuous beauty and these things are relegated to the past the city we know to be of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff the streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot the city decays in step with the protagonist only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous man the death of his daughter and presumably his wife along with the failure of his music allow us to understand why he is destroying himself alfred with whom aschenbach has in depth conversations on the meaning of beauty and who can create it but alfred is more than a friend he is aschenbach s alter ego and what alfred says articulates the composer s own doubts and fears the scene in which aschenbach decides to leave venice is immediately followed by a clip of alfred telling him that he is weak alienated and lacks feelings in the end we might be able to conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all it is a decay of memory rather than objective renderings of the past these flashbacks become distorted memories we can say that these are decayed memories because even aschenbach alludes to it he declares reality distracts and degrades us and following the scene in the travel agent s office we see aschenbach confront tadzio and his family and warn them leave venice but directly after the encounter we see him sitting with the clerk again and realize it was all in his imagination he employs long scenes without dialogue that are framed by the poignant music of gustav mahler he allows the viewer s mind to wander as we watch aschenbach s life and respectability decay with the beauty around him slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion that is mixed with a growing awareness that the town is suffocating in filth the crumbling city sets the stage for the middle aged man s attraction to tadzio it is romantic longing for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed even in fantasy the beauty of this polish boy kindles a fire in him that at first makes him glow then consumes him the film concludes with von aschenbach sitting feebly in a beach chair watching tadzio fight with his friend we see the black dye from his hair running down on his cheek and it looks like rotten blood it is a vision of his life s expiring moments though before his last breath the final decay has happened all around him the city is soiled and with it he has become what he detests as aschenbach dies he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film a man that had disturbed him it was the pursuit of beauty that initiated his decay in the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not sense his own demise and that of the city around him his sensuality is indulged in while constantly kept in check by the presence of death and decay it is these three themes that tie the damned and death in venice together beauty death and decay these themes are visconti s art the beauty of his work is in the decay of beauty itself in this film we are treated to the deliquescence of one great man we see the honored composer gustav von aschenbach in the pursuit of true and pure beauty and it is in the pursuit of this trait that it decays all around him and leads him to a miserable lonely death watching the target of his affection i believe that through these movies visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last decay is intrinsic in the world around us and when we become distracted it can destroy the splendor in death in venice it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that all is deleted beauty and deliquescence are woven together like thorns in visconti s works at once beautiful and destructive it is these themes that define his art 
451,child sexploitation is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and i feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience after having seen both trade and holly one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws the other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide i do not believe that turning this issue into a hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and i must commend the makes of holly for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure trade wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts i found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause if i had wanted a cheap laugh i would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking for anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something i would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of holly 
976,i can t believe we don t have that 70 s show anymore i have all 8 seasons of that 70 s show i absolutely love it i lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before i go to sleep at the end of a long busy day it s nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep i was so sad they took the show off air at least we still have the re runs i am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion like maybe when donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and eric get married wouldn t that be awesome it would be even better if they would continue it for several years 
338,miyazaki has been doing his mojo since the 70s and it s only been recently that his movies have made it american shores via disney and fans fawning over his great talent ponyo is no exception although some of his other movies have been a bit more accessible to us audiences some may find this one a bit on the fence being sort of japanese in its presentation for the same reason pom poko is very japanese and doesn t make much sense to us audiences so too are some elements of ponyo this should not detract you from watching this fun film of growth hope and friendship what does come across well is miyazaki s very elaborate and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy that coupled with his characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters he steps out of his zone a bit with ponyo as the main character is a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mom while his dad is away at work on the high seas although not lonely sosuke is just like any other curious boy who likes adventure and allure of the sea similar to spirited away we see the different worlds of the humans and the sea creatures and i feel that miyazaki may be trying to draw the viewers attention to the vast and undiscovered nature of things that live beneath the sea and our acceptance of them and thing that are different i managed to watch the subtitled version of this last year and was pleased by the story and plot miyazaki has claimed that this is my last movie for many years but shortly after spirited away he gave us howl s moving castle ponyo is certainly proof that miyazaki has not hung up his spurs and continues to delight innovate and pioneer the most creative animated movies of all time watch ponyo with an open mind and a tip of the hat to childhood fantasy and imagination and you ll be transported back to when catching fireflies and secret hiding places were more important than boring grown up stuff and eating your vegetables 
161,dumb excuse for a thriller with absolutely zero chemistry or reason in relationship between lewis and hurt why is she dating a man old enough to be her father anyway the suspense is laughable lewis is very good but a script is needed and there isn t one my score for this trash 2 out of 10 
89,i ll dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies they are too numerous to name a much shorter list would be what they got right 1 dude named noah 2 ark with animals on it if you want a much more accurate portrayal of noah s ark and the destruction of sodom go rent the bible 1966 it depicts the story of creation through abraham attempting to sacrifice his son isaac it s a much better movie and it may be that the abomination called noah s ark 1999 drove you to seek just such a film http www imdb com title tt0060164 i really couldn t stomach watching the whole movie from reading other comments i can see that even the atheists found it grossly inaccurate as a christian it was intolerable to me possibly the worst movie ever made no real point to this movie either except maybe to showcase their sub par computer animation was it a complete waste maybe not god can use evil to work good romans 8 28 says 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose genesis 50 says 20 but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive in the second example joseph s brothers meant to kill him but god turned their evil into a very great good he may have done the same thing with this movie people were so astonished by its lack of biblical foundation that they probably broke out the dusty old bible and read the story for themselves to find out about lot and sodom they would have to go the whole way up to genesis 19 before god destroys sodom and gomorrah by then they have read almost half of genesis so they might want to finish the next book is exodus which the movie the ten commandments was based on and much more accurately if they have seen that movie then exodus becomes an easy read so now they have read at least two whole books of the bible just because they watched a pathetic movie about noah s ark i m sure this actually happened to someone out there god works in mysterious ways 
131,jim wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded komodo vs cobra no guesswork here a giant cgi komodo dragon it sort of looks like a dog minus fur takes on a humongous cgi king cobra with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between the tree huggers get charter boat captain michael pare who else to take them to an off limits federal island an experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very large critters thank so to our nutty military now all that s left on the island are the very large critters and the mad scientist s tiny shapely daughter the group runs into her at the old plantation lab the monsters arrive and the chase is on if you watch enough wynorski sci fi channel flicks you ll recognize some of the sets and locations from many other movies acting is nonexistent as is the plot at the very least you can enjoy watching the badly animated compo dog stomp down on its intended victims just before scarfing them up the cobra just strikes and swallows no imagination at all 
512,i did something a little daring tonight when i watched this movie i attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores sure when this film originally was distributed a piano score was probably played with it oftentimes the director would choose the score himself charlie chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films but most of the music you hear on vhs tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released and then again there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score i do not know the history of potemkin s score so i decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within film soon after i turned the music off unaided or should i say unimpeded by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen i became utterly attached to the film visually it is easily one of the most stunning of all films eisenstein was a master of composition the editing possibly the cinematic technique eisenstein is most famous for montage is extraordinary the mood of this film is anger and it stirred my passions violently it takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film especially a drama but films like battleship potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it come on you owe it to yourself to watch this film your education is incomplete without it 
839,what happened those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen nightmare on elm st had gone noticeably downhill after it s cult classic of a first film but i doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film and nobody is more distraught about it than i am this is by far the worst anoes film of the lot it doesn t seem too bad at the beginning with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather elongated shower scene featuring alice but then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of events i mean sure freddy movies are supposed to be dreamlike and creepy but this one is like a train wreck in it s poor sequencing of events and awful plot setup it feels like you re coming down with a terrible headache not like you re getting scared so the directing totally fails none of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic the death by food especially except for that one cool scene that s crafted like a comic book battle that s why this movie gets a point the storyline lame lame lame lame it was an excuse to gross people out and to make the mpaa mad and nothing more the acting should i mention how freddy has been turned into a childish boogey man like clown figure how his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year old s horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we ve all known and loathed since the first film that arm waving and stupid chuckling as he appeared again ugh and his one liners too throughout the whole movie they suck badly a grade schooler could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit freddy spews throughout the 90 minute duration of the film hell a chimpanzee could come up with much funnier lines than what freddy s been told to say here who wrote the script for this this movie is really irritating too it seems so pointless like a gnat buzzing around your head a gnat that just won t go away freddy is just an annoyance now we ve seen him so many times before this one s nothing different and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one liners and get off your tv screen alice instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie seems annoying and very shallow and this is obviously due to the horrible horrible script this movie was fitted with lisa wilcox may be a great actor and sometimes it shines through the cracks here but she can t save this movie the other actors just suck mostly the last 15 or 20 minutes of freddy s existence in this film are awful and embarrassing i hope englund was ashamed of this who wants to see freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out laughing like a cartoon villain this movie destroyed anything positive i felt for the nightmare series i can t ever watch them again without this image running through my head of the mangled cartoon abomination that krueger became he was slowly becoming a jokey retarded pop culture icon but this is the lowest of the low this is rock bottom nobody will ever take freddy krueger seriously again after seeing this film he s naught but a joke a clown that is long overdue for retirement pathetic of all the movies i could hate why did it have to be nightmare on elm st a series which i once adored and liked a lot the dream child represents the death of a legend and the shattering of any hope i had in the nightmare on elm st series freddy would go on to continue his downward spiral into clown status in the next installment freddy s dead which was more entertaining than this was actually and then he would go on to bring down the mood in freddy vs jason and finally he would putter out into nothing which is for the best i know this has mostly been a rant about why freddy sucks now but this movie is overall horrible and one of the worst movies ever made not recommended to anyone and even anoes completionists won t want to see this one again 
705,the annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story it s something i would have done my 1st year in film school very sad additionally the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story which makes me feel that the creative team didn t really know what they were doing or just that it should have been shorter which would have been a blessing not a crime as i have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week i d have to say that this was by far the worst and i just wanted to warn others not to start with this one 
94,this is a movie about a man everybody thinks is jewish this is a movie about lawrence newman who lives in brooklyn in the 1940 s at the time of wwii one day when he gets himself glasses people start thinking he s a jew and that only because he looks like one and he lives in a very antisemitic neighborhood so some people start treating him like dirt they make that judgment being a jew of larry s fresh wife gertrude hart too that makes their lives unbearable neal slavin s focus 2001 is a fairly good look at the antisemitism that s a problem that won t go away the movie is based on athur miller s novel which i admit i haven t read but the movie is really good so i m sure the book would also the actors do good job william h macy is always good and his work as larry newman is brilliant laura dern is gert hart and she s magnificent meat loaf is almost scary as the neighbor who wants to keep jews out by any means necessary david paymer s character as the jewish shop owner mr finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the movie paymer is the perfect choice for the role one of the greatest scenes is in the end when mr finkelstein and newman fight against those nazi like people with baseball bats they join together to fight the evil the christian and the jew 
130,edith nesbitt s best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film i love it the film itself has gorgeous cinematography and fine realisation of the subject matter the ending is enough to have you in tears as it is so beautifully done lionel has directed some truly excellent films like the amazing mr blunden but this is his best film as director by a mile the costumes were absolutely lovely that matched the beauty of the countryside and the sparkling and conveniently faithful script helped matters however it is the quality of the acting that holds this film together as it is nothing shorter than incredible dinah sheridan is suitably sincere as the mother a much needed characteristic of the character and bernard cribbins was hilarious as perks in fact i preferred perks on film as he isn t as humorous in the book the children were perfect gary warren and sally thomsett both gave spirited performances but it is jenny agutter s enchanting portrayal of bobbie that impressed me the most another special mention is the gorgeous music by johnny douglas the title music reminded me of charlie chaplin s smile in conclusion a funny and poignant masterpiece that is better than the book i think 10 10 bethany cox 
742,pretty dreadful movie about several unbalanced young people in a car starts off reasonably well but becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses rachel leigh cook is the sole highlight in a tender and sexy performance but i would recommend this film only to die hard fans of the actress 
806,unfortunately many great films on imdb such as this one have their scores adjusted by imdb this is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of bonnie and clyde little big man night moves mickey one and the chase if you click in the user rating area you ll see that the actual median for four friends is 7 6 however imdb has adjusted dumbed down the rating to 6 4 per imdb imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at vote stuffing by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it the exact methods we use will not be disclosed this should ensure that the policy remains effective in other words we won t disclose our methods so you can t question how we arrived at the score what a shame to see fine thought provoking films like four friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to imdb s filters 
977,isabelle huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation la pianiste truly confirms it as if that wasn t enough annie girardot plays her mother and annie girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation so as you may well imagine those pieces of casting are worth the horror we re put through isabelle and annie play characters we ve never seen before on the screen a mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes i was unable even to blink or to breath personally i don t believe in the director s intentions i don t believe they the intentions that is go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but i was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational huppert and the fierceness of girardot s strength i highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the collectors of great performances like me you can t afford to miss la pianiste 
973,life is crazy you re crazy i m crazy we re all crazy we re all a little bit minnie and a little bit moskowitz sometimes it does seem best to be sensible but then what might you be missing out on you gotta be you you don t have to park cars and semi randomly yell at people but you can t hide yourself behind a veil or dark sunglasses and pretend and act like everything is okay and sometimes you really do have to throw caution to the wind because why else are you alive i m not going to rate this love compared to cassavetes other movies because they are all absolutely 100 unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives in that sense they are all great and comparisons are odious for sure this movie has that one crazy sometimes maddening but ultimately wonderful and freeing quality that all his movies have you never know what s going to happen next and you never know what the characters are going to think do or feel next neither do the characters themselves and do we really want to live our lives any other way unlike moskowitz you can have a great job and judiciously sock away money into your ira but still live the life of an adventurer inside in your feelings your spirit and your very experience of life yeah we can have it both ways that s what cassavetes shows us thank god somebody did 
79,i don t think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions i tolerated the first season unfortunately this is a show about lawyers who aren t really lawyers god forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show it just made me gag a bit that aside spader and shatner who are supposed to be the stars of the show are the most annoying while this might be a compliment in some situations it s certainly not here their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first but since that s what they re doing literally all the time i ve realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get trying to intersperse some serious dramatic and even tear jerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest i ve been experiencing trying to enjoy the show alan shore s flamboyant and gratuitous public service announcements where he spouts off his opinions do not impress denny crane is just annoying i was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for crane s speech wearing a colonial outfit i m giving two stars because there are moments where i thought the show s attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care i think the show s writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by denny and alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start the thing is i don t care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well but i just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more i m not a teenager anymore and i think this show is promising if its goal wasn t to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratings of course i m writing this after i realized that it s really not gonna get much better than this it s a shame because it s one of those shows i d love to love 
831,i never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re runs i actually enjoyed it for the first to third season once i saw the fourth and fifth one i was beginning to get irate the first problem was that they did that irrelevant scenario of history repeating itself jr having a kid like his parents did the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone ex katie and franklin the third one was when they made jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where i wanted to go into the t v and beat the stupidity out of him until he s unconscious the fourth one had to be that zealous dork that clarie claimed as a boyfriend the fifth one had to be katie she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her boyfriend franklin like the pushover he was the last but not least was noah gray cabey franklin franklin was just scary it was like watching a terrible combination of urkle and tj henderson only more annoying they seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show there was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that noah can t act eveytime i saw that kid just made me want slap he silly however b f before frank this show was funny and very entertaining 
691,shocking in 1965 i saw jury gagarin alive he was sincere unpretentious and kindly he was at ease and looked like well educated and intellectual person in this movie i saw a clown the actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry they made a cartoon the real gagarin was someone else don t believe in this movie i saw this movie after the movies like taming of fire and apollo 13 and after reading books rockets and people by chertok and korolev myths and facts by golovanov i was shocked by tiresome scenario poor acting and producing and a lots of inexactitudes of space race the movie is the tedious rendering of well known in russia historical facts a lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated some facts and details were perverted for example in 1945 korolev was already not a prisoner liberated in 1944 and in 1940 he was already not in kolyma prison gold mine but in special prison design bureau korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners but in the movie korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform imho the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can t to make interesting movies 
743,of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst i took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it the script seemed to be based on a willy wonka style story but it just didn t have anything to it if you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time it is bad they are making a sequel so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie but i don t think it is possible 
988,i love kristen dunst especially in elizabethtown i guess she s the kind of actress who had better not act before camera but just be herself she did that and she looked so natural in elizabethtown in this movie however she did try to add in more artificial performance especially in the first half of the film so that she looked more like a sober editor while in the other half she totally set herself back in her daily track and i just couldn t tell her to be an editor any way therefore her performance is not enduring in this film the film on the whole is attracting and inspiring the character of young is full and reasonable anyway the film tells a big and sophisticated story the only big defect is that it didn t show a turning point of the hero and heroine s love story i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story because that is rather unclear for the two persons 
136,this movie gives golf a high mark it was well acted and well directed giving you a view of history that some non sports fans will enjoy the historic factor alone gives it a high rating the brookline golf course was really done well i am in the northeast and have seen brookline as a fan and as someone who loves the game the movie was well done on all levels a must see 5 stars the acting was superb disney has another winner in its bag of great movies if for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life i would tell you that the setting while in the late 1800 s and early 1900 s is very realistic the costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film a must see for fans and non fans alike 
499,as an adventure mini series this is about as good as it gets i viewed it when it was originally shown on hbo sigrid is totally believable in her role as philadelphia and the whole production was first rate see all 400 minutes of it if you can i highly recommend this mini series amazing that i can t rate it officially but for you readers users i will let you know it s a solid 10 
303,although i have to admit i laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies i saw the budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors the production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch reminds me of the robot monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on in one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off geez hard to believe but the black knight scene from holy grail was more realistic i kept wondering why the victim didn t start shouting none shall pass and it s only a flesh wound i ve had worse it was one of the funniest scenes i ve seen in the past year the gladiator demon was a stitch too between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film 
165,i was not making big assumptions on the fact that this for sure was a very very free adaptation from the work of eça de queiroz and i must say that this free adaptation form the book as a lot of possible good ideas and characters the problem is the way that is done without any care without any taste just a rumble of bad taste clichés everywhere the script is so fake and the characters so unreal that s makes petty seeing nice actors as unas bryner morgado lagarto and others lost themselves in a net of whatever except cinema or storytelling for my surprise the newcomers jorge corrula and soraia chaves bravely stick in their performances but you can see them lost like a drifted boat without any direction and talking about direction this seems to be something totally missing on this movie where s the director everything is bad taste the frames are whatever and whenever the use of hand camera without any justified reason the light design that should build environments doesn t exist and no excuses that the all point is a dark real story the problem overall in this trying to be film is that as no taste or very very bad taste it s sad to see jorge and soraia melting away in such fake and gratuity sex scenes painted here and there trough out the movie like closing narratives holes or used as fakes transition motives maybe carlos coelho da silva should see the 2002 carlos carrera adaptation of the same book of eça and get the felling of how to build a true movie 
774,this film was very interesting to me virtually a film within a film which is about a very whimsical director who cleverly persuades an actress and and actor who happen to dislike each other in producing sexual chemistry on film the director is faced with a fusillade of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film sex is comedy is much more than a comedy packed with uncomfortable quirky moments the movie also addresses the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women in regards to the sometimes controversial act of sex i loved this film the character jeanne played by the beautiful anne parillaud performs wonderfully on screen as you share in her struggle to produce a motion picture work of art 
739,this was a crappy movie with a whole lotta non sense and too many loose ends to count i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ron livingston made a cameo in it and i continued watching it because as a girl i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change later i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get and each time it got more ridiculous sean crawley good looking chris l mckenna whom i ve never seen before but loved his little nude scene is making ends meet as a painter when he meets electrician duke wayne george wendt from cheers thinking he s getting more work from duke sean agrees to meet contractor ray matthews daniel baldwin playing a stereotypically evil guy ray is being investigated by a city hall accountant ron livingston in a cameo who i ve been in love with from office space up to sex the city ray end up offering the apparently desperate for cash sean 13k to kill the accountant and sean accepts the job sean stalks out the accountant whose wife kari wuhrer he finds himself attracted to completes the hit and leaves taking the file of information against ray with him sean quickly learns he was being used that ray never intended to pay him and sean uses the file as leverage to get his money up to this point it s a descent flick generally worth watching but as soon as ray duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him it just got dumber and dumber and still dumber until finally it seemed like the film s writer charlie higson had snapped out of a 10 day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something without simply detailing the movie let s just say that in every single scene you watch after the kidnapping you find yourself gasping what the f k baffled by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption in the end so many loose ends are left in the movie that you begin to regret that you even watched it this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it s full value it s supposed to be a psychological thriller and mckenna is a decent actor but it s hard to give yourself to the movie when you have norm from cheers and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense guys will love the violence blood and guts scenes and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots girls will enjoy handsome sean s gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie personally i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ron livingston is only in the first one third of the movie 
285,another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the us government and the armed forces especially the army for every disaster since the great flood anyone who has ever served time in the us military can see how bogus this film is uniforms equipment sets and mannerisms are all wrong and of course all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years uses every cliche rumor and urban legend from the gulf all are presented as gospel the truth is no one knows for sure why some gw vets are sick and others are healthy as horses ps this is not new war is not fun and i know wwii korean and viet nam vets with some pretty serious ailments too and the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them sensationalistic movies like this will not solve the problem 
911,given christopher nolan s string of successful films it s a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature which is shot in black and white back in england running less than 70 minutes long done with little budget but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storyteller though short the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing because the premise doesn t even scratch the surface of this tale which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narrative s structure and characterization as told we follow a writer wannabe called bill jeremy theobald who starts a habitual obsession with following random people he fancies on the streets in a voyeuristic manner which at first could be conceived as research before he starts to make up his own rules and break them he meets up with charismatic cobb alex haw who turns out to be a robber with peculiar sensibilities and modus operandi and soon finds himself hooked with hanging out with him as they go about breaking and entering and speculating about their victim s livelihood as does the pursuit of a femme fatale blond lucy russell a mobster s moll who rejects his every advance told in a non linear fashion which comes with scenes that don t quite add up in the beginning this sets the film up for multiple viewings as you study just how nolan sustains that suspense and intrigue with you as the audience expecting and wanting more which gets duly delivered there are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo where loose ends begin to come together and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine through it s also amazing how as a first feature shot on the cheap that something that clever and sophisticated can be conceived from his own experience in being burgled with nolan involved in every stage of production from writing to shooting producing and directing having worked on the project for a year since shoots can only happen on weekends i guess here s an example of a successful filmmaker s humble roots which should serve as inspiration and spur new filmmakers out there now i ll patiently wait for christopher nolan s inception due out later this year whose trailer is already such a tease 
803,so the wife and i just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off for the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie there was just very little excitement the acting was atrocious to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes the church lady for example the dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like the ring rather then get the police involved which i m sure those earplugs she found would have dna all over them she instead devises a horrible plan to get the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister i call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too which the movie then fades to black bad dialog bad acting bad ending 
121,i had seen this movie long time back but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me a wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of australian commandos who tried to sink some japanese ships at the singapore harbor during the height of ww2 these commandos are caught in plain clothes and they are considered to be spies by the japanese captors but something happens that hasn t been explored much in any hollywood ww2 movie that i have seen a close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives they begin to respect each other while the captain of the captured australian soldiers become the best of friends with a senior japanese prison guard this is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really tugs your heart soon one day as the two friends are conversing the aussie captain learns that some other captives are going to be tried and executed for the sinking of the jap ships in the singapore harbor he mentions that it was his team and not some other s that had sunk the ships to his japanese friend and upon hearing this the japanese guard tells him to keep quiet as it might lead to his whole group getting executed but the captain remains adamant on confessing this to the japanese authorities finally the japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most respectful way that is according to their rules this is the highest honor accorded to the captured warriors in japan this is the most awesome part of the film where the aussie soldiers are awaiting their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why did his aussie friend confess being guilty i won t give away the ending here but it is more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears all in all an excellent underrated movie that possibly didn t get the recognition that it deserved internationally get one copy today and be mesmerized 
654,another raquel welch classic this picture hit the theaters november 10 1969 starring raquel welch as michele james stacey as joe and luke askew as alan morris nikki is on her way to meet with her girl friends michele and jackie while on her way there she runs into her ex husband who wants a second chance nikki walk away from him goes to the table where she sees michele and jackie alan approaches her again and she starts to walk away when alan shoots her in the back nikki is taken to the hospital while michele and jackie go to the police station michele goes to the hospital where she meets up with jackie only to find that nikki died alan then goes after jackie who he hits with a car and then tries to run michele down michele jumps into her car and heads for los angeles when she gets there she calls lloyd her boss in las vegas to let him know that she was all right lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see jeri about a job however there s one problem the bartender has a drug problem and alan knows it so alan and the bartender have a little talk back in los angeles michele not only gets a job as a dancer with jeri but also hooks up with jeri bouncer joe now some thoughts on this picture this picture was far better then raquel last and this one had nonstop action luke askew did a fine job of playing nikki ex husband he was your typical murder with the look that goes with it as for raquel welch performance the only word that comes to mine is fantastic she was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and shined like never before the outfit that she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking in fact all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking of course it doesn t matter what raquel had on because she looks good in everything or nothing i give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons the first and by far is raquel welch who s the leading actress and deserves 10 stars the second reason is that this movie was wall to wall excitement from beginning to end 
386,oh man i know what your thinking with a title like that i can t go wrong uh yes you can i too loved the title but man i hated the stupid kid that played satan s little helper i hated the mom too and the sister daughter and her boyfriend i hated all those people man it was agony watching this sometimes the only reason this doesn t get 1 10 is becuz condsidering the low budget they did ok but oh man did i hate those actors so stupid i knew it was going to be bad i guess they saved a lot of money on just using halloween masks for the killer and the jesus costume at the end was really stupid too oh the agony do not watch 
214,sergio martino is a great director who has contributed a lot to italian genre cinema and as far as i am considered his gialli from the 1970s are the undisputed highlights in his impressive repertoire la coda dello scorpione aka the case of the scorpion s tale of 1971 is one of these impressive films martino has contributed to italian horror s most original sub genre and another proof that the man is a master of atmosphere style and suspense my personal favorite of the martino films i ve seen so far is still the insanely brilliant your vice is a locked room and only i have the key of 1972 followed by torso 1973 and the strange vice of mrs wardh 1971 all of which i personally like even more than this one that s purely a matter of personal taste however as la coda dello scorpione is an equally excellent film that is essential for every fan of italian horror cinema and suspense in general the film which delivers tantalizing suspense from the very beginning has a complex and gripping plot that begins with the mysterious demise of a millionaire who has died in a plane crash insurance investigator peter lynch george hilton is assigned to verify the circumstances the insurance company which is due to pay a large sum to the deceased man s wife soon after lynch begins to investigate a person is brutally killed which is just the beginning of a series of murders the case of the scorpion s tail excellently delivers all the elements a great giallo needs the film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning the score by bruno nicolai is brilliant the plot is wonderfully convoluted and the killer s identity remains a mystery until the end regular giallo leading man george hilton once again delivers an excellent performance in the lead sexy anita strindberg is absolutely ravishing in the female lead the includes the great luigi pistilli one of the most brilliant regulars of italian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s and alberto de mendoza another great actor who should be familiar to any lover of italian cinema athens where most of the film takes place is actually a great setting for a giallo the atmosphere is constantly gripping and the photography great and bruno nicolai s ingenious score makes the suspense even more intense long story short la coda dello scorpione is another excellent giallo from sergio martino and an absolute must see for any lover of the sub genre stylish suspenseful and great in all regards 
314,oh man is this movie bad it flows horribly the story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this doesn t love himself he tries getting out of the contract and horrible painfully unfunny gags ensue jim nabors seems as if he s sleepwalking not acting you ll miss such burt sidekicks as dom deluise and jerry reed while watching this stinker loni anderson s hair is downright scary proving that tons of hairspray didn t go out in the sixties or maybe that was a wig speaking of burt s wig wasn t bad in this film his worst wig day was in smokey and the bandit 2 anyhow this movie is the worst reynolds car movie ever ever right up there with cannonball run 2 the original smokey and cannonball and hooper which thankfully had no sequel are great funny films this one isn t even ned beatty who is a great actor stinks you ll long for a jackie gleason type villain who is fun to hate and mind you this isn t one of those fun movies to bag on it s lousy pure and simple even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring and worst of all unfunny and least i forget stroker ace was one of the first heavy nails to seal burt s coffin before his somewhat revival years later in boogie nights another film that like deliverance years earlier shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so 
645,ok i just have 3 words cheesy cheesy and cheesy the only redeeming feature of this movie is dean cain other than that it s cheeseball supreme the movie does have some promise in the concept an underground lab creates a real live fire breathing dragon basically giving us more of jurassic park meets reign of fire there are some great possibilities but they just don t follow through the special effects are decent even though you know the dragon is cgi it doesn t horribly look like cgi i wouldn t lay the blame on dean cain although he is one of the producers i d lay more of the blame on phillip roth the director and writer it s his job to make this film and unfortunately he failed 
309,as much as i like big epic pictures i ll spare you the namedropping it s great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes films where the plot takes a backseat to the set pieces films where the dialogue isn t so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose there are hundreds of films that fit the bill but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better ones it s an update of the movie that shares its name it also shares that picture s ethos but not quite it s execution whatever was great about the original has been streamlined whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster see the pug ugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it but here thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors sixty succeeds the plot and much of the dialogue isn t much to write imdb about often you ll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors each of whom will voice it with different inflections a lot of people found this annoying i find it raises a smile each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here with cage jolie and duvall leading the pack of course and it should be noted that it s also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here the chemistry between good ol saint nick the stalwart see date of review and angelina leads to a couple of nice moments the villain is not even a little scary i ve seen chris eccleston play tough guy roles before so i know he can handle them but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action we know the heroes are going to succeed somehow we re just sitting in the car with them enjoying the ride i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating in fact i wouldn t have minded some fourth wall breaking winks at the camera it s just that kind of movie all this style and not so much substance something that often exhausts my patience if not executed just so would be worthless if the action wasn t there and for the most part it is wonderfully so i ve noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast cut extreme close up shots to direct action these days i personally find this kind of thing exhausting i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time i ve been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance in real life i mean his character clearly doesn t care and it shows the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow burning climatic finale where he drives a mustang into the ground in the most outlandish and fun way possible so yes this movie isn t an epic life affirming post 9 11 picture with obligatory social commentary effort the pacing is uneven some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line but car movies rarely come better than this so if you hate cars why are you even reading these comments i d take it over the numerous iterations of the flaccid and the tedious guess the franchise any day 7 10
928,i have to say i totally loved the movie it had it s funny moments some heartwarming parts just all around good me personally really liked the movie because it s something that finally i can relate to my childhood this movie in my opinion is geared more towards the young gay population it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up all the taunting name calling and not knowing is something i like most other young feminine boys will always remember and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay so i would definitely recommend seeing this movie probably shouldn t really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
783,i like breillat s movies but this one is the best i ve seen at balancing animal warmth with sexual intelligence anne parillaud is electric and the script is amazing especially considering it s supposed to take place on the set of another of breillat s movies you don t have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this it made me think a lot about vulnerability and power try to imagine a male director with jeanne s openness not impossible but a little mind bending the unannounced sexual undercurrents that are always present when humans get together to make anything is held up to bright light here but not a cold light 
447,saxophonist ronnie bowers dick powell wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood he stays at hollywwod hotel of course at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall lola lane has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia rosemary lane to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him it s not marshall naturally they fall in love you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself the plot is old to put it nicely but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices the score is good highlighted by hooray for hollywood and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive in musical sequence with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesie still the movie isn t that good the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy also there is racism a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there s some truly appalling racist humor at one point that s probably what keeps this off tv most of the time i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today all in all a so so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs i give it a 7 
897,hare rama hare krishna was the biggest hit movie of 1971 filmed almost entirely in kathmandu the capital of nepal the movie depicts not only with the theme of a broken family but also a relationship between a brother and a sister as well as drugs and the hippie movement which made many people think that it involved the iskon the movement for krishna consciousness the movie begins with scenes of drugs and being informed that the woman dancing in front is the narrator s sister going back to the past the brother and sister are happily playing around the house only to hear their parents arguing this soon leads to a split in the family the brother goes with the mother and the sister with the father as years pass the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that she no longer lives with the father and that she has moved to nepal here prashant the brother not only finds love but he also finds his sister janice but he finds out that she is not only in the wrong company of friends but is also on drugs as she wants to block all memory of her past with help of shanti his love the brother tries to get his sister away from all this but has to overcome many obstacles including people who stoop to all sorts of levels to stop him this is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself dev anand and also stars zeenat aman her first movie mumtaz rajendranath prem chopra jnr mehmood a k hangal and achala sachdev the music is superbly provided by the late r d burman whose last score was 1942 a love story during the filming dev anand asked panchamda r d burman to compose something special for this film days later panchamda came back with the composition of dum maro dum the song was an instant hit 
72,this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s jack pearl radio s baron munchausen as well as jimmy durante however 7 1 2 decades later it s being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts as for the stooges this is a film from there very early days before mgm had any idea what to do with the team at this point they were known as ted healy and his stooges as healy was the front man fortunately for the stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on him you ll see what i mean and the rest is history within a year they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of buster keaton laurel and hardy abbott and costello and others in fact up until they left for columbia mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film roles including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady and oddly in this film they didn t act as a team they just did various supporting roles such as larry playing the piano this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle when they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there as for pearl i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films as he has the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome as for durante i never knew what the public saw in him as least as far as his films are concerned he was loud and loud he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton s career to make this film together pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor and vaudeville style routines that tend to fall rather flat in this film the stooges they didn t yet have the right chemistry seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd what they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though die hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life long goal of seeing everything stooge even the rotten joe derita and joe besser films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curly overall the film is rather dull and disappointing however there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess at about the 13 minute mark you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing look carefully as this is walter brennan in a role you d certainly never expect another unusual thing to look for in the film is the clean as a whistle song starting at about 22 minutes into the film this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so called pre code scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the production code was strengthened despite the word clean in the title it s a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything it s quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s finally at the 63 minute mark see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades see the film you ll see that i mean 
46,there s only one thing i m going to say about cat in the hat as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren t exactly kid appropriate oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying as for the plot i completely forgot who cares it sucked anyway i m not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded but so what it was annoying don t see it it belongs in the bottom 100 the jokes are so unkiddy it s funny
440,this is my favorite renoir from the fifties it s the story of how henri danglard built and launched the moulin rouge nightclub we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway and the training of the dancers finally the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described gabin is in great form as the easy going danglard see him deal humorously with nini s violent boyfriend gianni esposito is moving as the wistful prince who is courting nini maria felix with that amazon s body is imposing as the egotistical lola danglard s first lover finally françoise arnoul as nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for danglard and becoming his girl is just stunning her loveliness and pert charm will win you over a bonus we get edith piaf patachou andré claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the moulin rouge 
206,what i loved about the on screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel great film as an avid reader i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film ellen burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar however i think the canadian actress christine horne chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise i haven t seen any of horne s previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer 2008 i can t wait to see it on the big screen again 
250,watching josh kornbluth act in this movie reminds me of my freshman tv production class where the not funny had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were obvious is the word that comes to mind when i try to synopsize this wannabe comedy the jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed the delivery is painfully bad ouch the writing is simply dorkish it is akin to a bob saget show watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit post belushi i hated this movie and want my money back 
257,poorly acted and poorly directed congo unsuccessfully tries to recreate the feeling of jurassic park but the truth is the book wasn t all that great either still the movie s first problem is that tim curry s character was added the second problem is that the talking arm was added the main problem though is that the cast members don t create realistic characters i guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are killer gorillas anywhere on earth also starring laura linney happy birthday laura dylan walsh ernie hudson grant heslov joe don baker james karen and bruce campbell i m guessing that they don t wish to emphasize this movie in their resumes 
327,starring jim carrey morgan freeman jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie i mean what a conceptual nightmare jim carrey playing god nothing is sacred anymore well this movie is hardly sacred but it also is not sacrilegious at least not to any great extent yes jim carrey has the powers of god for a while but he is not god confused i ll give you the low down jim carrey plays bruce nolan a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life he lives with his beautiful girlfriend grace anniston and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground then bruce gets a shot at anchorman only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter obviously not please bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired much complaining and griping about god later bruce gets a page after a while he gets tired of it calling so he responds and goes to the omni presents building heh there he meets god freeman who is the boss electrician and janitor of the building i found this highly amusing god is the boss the holy spirit is the electrician and jesus christ is the janitor think about it boss obvious electrician the guy who keeps everything running janitor the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left brilliant anyway bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god he starts to believe a bit wonder why enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies since this is hollywood bruce obviously eventually smartens up learns his lesson and starts using his powers for the good of the world in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done not bruce s since it is jim carrey the movie is quite amusing and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it the movie is not perfect theology but for hollywood it is definitely a good attempt many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie so while far from perfect definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it bottom line 3 5 out of 4 worth a view or two 
211,i watch lackawanna blues every time it comes on it brings back happy times for me i grow up in a big city in the mid west it reminds me of when i was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same it makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost the big mama s of day are under the age of 55 will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other i hope that i was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past the music was great in this movie i truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters i would have paid to see it as i viewed the movie for the second time i figured out who life this movie was about he did an superb job in writing and producing this film i guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you as soon as i can i will be obtaining a copy for my home use i alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than thanks for such a great movie 
369,i m not sure how i can make ten lines out of this question but i ll try when julie went to the dance and they were dancing to slow music what was the name of the song that was playing and who played it i love that song and i watch the movie over and over just to hear that one song i did several searches online and even looked up the soundtrack but i sill can t find the song it might be because the song they were dancing to wasn t a complete song and just partial i would appreciate if anyone out there who knows what the name of the song and the group who sung it thank you frank
948,this trashy b movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick the story revolves around sammy horn subtle name played by michael des barres sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife grace rosanna arquette and a young child he has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting social security the story is centered on a conversation with his therapist nastassja kinski where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback this is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts which consumes at least 75 of the screen time it is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad the production values are abysmal the movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a tv soap opera at best and an amateur porn flick shot in someone s garage the direction by joseph brutsman is horrible with bad lighting uninspired framing and poor actor direction the script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation as an example grace s sister comes over to indignantly inform sammy that she knows he s been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife his response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her about three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more just as they finish grace walks in and sis says to her oh great to see you gotta run to pick up timmy and mum s the word about sammy s indiscretions the bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment no spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it the sex depictions are all overdone mechanical and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic most of them are done with both participants fully clothed the acting is wretched michael des barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle he really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts but when it comes to actually acting with arquette and kinski he is adrift rosanna arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal nastassja kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist but at least we have some acting happening here the rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like hit me harder is that the best you can do and oh god yes this movie is among the worst i have ever seen a dubious distinction given the thousands of films i have viewed i have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 1 10 not to be seen within three hours of any meal 
567,i wasn t expecting this to be a great movie but neither was i expecting it to be so awful i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel i turned it back hoping it was just one part of the movie but no and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed or almost done out of a job or driven to madness inside her own home are you kidding me i was raised to respect and even fear my mother but i d put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother s house after all i didn t buy any of it i tried giving it several chances i really did sorry 
55,my first opinions on this movie were of course bad i was expecting a horrible crappy acting bad entertainment ridiculous special effects movie what i got was actually not that bad the special effects were absolutely horrible but i found the movie itself quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decent the acting wasn t that bad and overall i had fun watching this movie it s still a pretty bad film but it s not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be and i m pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me even when it wasn t that good overall it s a film that should be avoided but to me it wasn t as bad as i was expecting it to be 
163,grabbed my attention on netflix instant play because it was only an hour and a half long it s nearing 4 am here and because it s norwegian which i wanted to follow up with dead snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now a droll and deliciously wry romp this movie features a man andreas who gets shipped out to some purgatory of a brave new world city where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste nothing smells and even sex loses its appeal driven to the edge by his lack of common senses he feels nearly ready to kill himself after an hilarious botched attempt at latter andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny vagina shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates the two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see but of course in fantasy allegory land desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end andreas attempt at freedom and sensuality jens lien and crew create a simple straight forward movement to the story one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging the similarities in other similar science fiction aren t worth enumerating but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones i like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie some disembowelment and flagellation that will get your heart stammering harder than the passion of the christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray toned mise en scene trond fausa aurvaag is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings which works very well despite the fact that the concept itself isn t anything to write home about everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world polarisdib
492,i wanted to like this one the situation was rich and the setting unusual and interesting but the story is swamped with childish female gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow the director is unfairly prejudiced against the goy characters content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures and inexplicably indulgent towards the homewrecking behavior of the heroine the potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really dealt with feminist film makers will get more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy to the heroine and start dealing honestly with issues this movie more closely resembles the 7 pieces of gold another earnest failure more than the piano a real tale of passion 
213,i m amazed that the hospital has been so well received by the critics and the public i found it dreary visually ugly and generally meaningless after the first virtually unwatchable 40 minutes the film does improve relatively but it remains way too far fetched not to mention unfunny to be successful as a satire and has too little substance to succeed as a drama the film s uncertain tone is its biggest fault overshadowing even scott s terrific as usual performance 
565, a trio of treasure hunters is searching the west indies for a hidden fortune the lure of gold makes for a rise in tension as the men come closer to the treasure s location the deep sea divers hope to track down the gold but find that greed and hatred leads to murder according to the dvd sleeve s synopsis manfish is the name of their boat not a monster the skeleton who gives muscular captain john bromfield as brannigan his half of the treasure map is very good old salt victor jory as professor provides the other half of the map first mate lon chaney jr as swede plays dumb and sexy tessa prendergast as alita guards the rum not very well obviously serious editing and continuity problems mar the picture which otherwise might have amounted to something manfish 2 56 w lee wilder john bromfield victor jory lon chaney jr 
234,being a fan of movies like fire sale where s poppa airplane i saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the aforementioned well wrong conclusion not only is this not funny it makes you angry because it isn t bad in a schlocky likable way but in a really bad way it s bad bad the script does not contain a single funny line which is rather in the way when you re trying to entertain your audience with humour adam arkin s speech impediment is probably the single most annoying thing in this movie still this cruelty of nature doesn t prevent him from being smug throughout the movie and he has a hard time not looking into the camera this amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuity errors and bumbling along of the story if you can find one ed mcmahon i had to think of jay leno another late night talk show person who always refuses to call himself an actor well i ve seen a few leno movies and he s laurence olivier compared to mcmahon kenneth mars is good though in the few lines that he s given i m not easily frightened by bad comedies so i kept watching and looking for all the quasi jokes every 5 minutes or so the movie actually becomes sort of a comedy as soon as alan arkin takes over he literally does starting 75 minutes into the movie he s in every scene but it s too little too late when movies try to fool you into believing their lack of professionalism is the reason you re supposed to like them because they have the right intentions they remind me of pupils that haven t prepared for an exam in those cases you have to remain strict and the grade has to be an f but please don t assume i m a teacher that is a profession with a respectability somewhere between politician and child molester if you actually look for a likable schlocky horror scifi movie that is fun to watch and does contain jokes try man with the screaming brain by bruce campbell or watch sunshine core if you prefer modern loud shallow scifi schlock those are equally funny albeit involuntarily

69,i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie but i had no idea what i was getting myself into i started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture i finally know what hell is like it s this movie for eternity this movie has no value it didn t even really have a plot there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens instead of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie don t even watch it not even to see how bad it is i beg you if you watch it then it means they win 
643, tip have it read to you heres how 1 copy and paste this to notepad not word 2 go to start all programs accessories accessabilty narratorhaving your testicles ironed when jonathan ross started his career he was on a show call the last resort now a days he is the first resort to host anything and anything tv award shows that half the time he is up for nominations in comic relief chat shows quiz shows game shows charity shows brighton just when you at you wits end and think you can find salvation in the wireless the lisping twang of good old j r hits you like a freight train going none stop from texas to downtown n y that has lost a hour and is trying to make it up about this show fnwjr its a normal chat show format with j r as host and a house band that concisest of four gay men ha ha ha ow my aching sides and season one had andy davis but he left or was fired to give way to ross s ego ross will more less use his guests as props and you really don t hear them speak because of his its my ball and i ll take it home attitude you also see that the bigger the guest the more he is willing to lie and suck up to them to get in with the big boys like the weak kid at school who hangs round with the bully however when a small reality t v star comes on he ll happily humiliate them asking personal questions about the past and telling them about their lack of talent to get the laughs sometimes he will under estimate the popularity of a guest say something to belittle them and then when the audience act shocked he will quickly turn and start making himself the fall guy the best example of this was when life on mars star john simm came on and he said how does someone like you get work your ok looking but not hollywood good looking bare in mind the hugh jackman and halle berry was in the green room he was really only trying to suck up to them before they were even on the couch when the audience acted shock ross quickly said what i m bit light headed from wearing that corset i don t know what i m saying if he don t have any low forms of tv life on he ll just dig at the four gay men on the piano with jokes more out of date than his fashion its very much a different story when a hollywood a lister or big tv star comes on the show in that he ll tell them stories to humor them when some actor explains that he was in a support band then jonathon ross will say something like wow well he ever i go to see a band i was try to look interested for the support band to make them feel as though they are wanted with an underline message being please like me i was probably one of the people that cheered you when you was in your band top this off with an audience of ross fans so hooked on every bad old joke and bulling it really makes for a poor show your better off watching us chat shows instead they are more scripted but not anywhere near as hard to watch 
197,lynch the man has some really great stuff he knows how to disturb us then reward us by getting us think in different ways this however is altogether different dumbland s reward is 1 absurd comedy earned by enduring 99 stupidity i may have laughed once but somewhere around episode 4 i just started watching on fast forward didn t miss a thing i felt relieved when it ended and that s part of the point with this series it s an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations rounded out with annoying animation voices and sound but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile

681,this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business the idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot i rented the film is discouraging also obsessed teacher 3 years prior kills teenager s family because he wants her for no reason he kills the mother father and brother from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison hmm usual bad writing no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around sniff out people and with a knife is super killer sure now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason knifes bellhop for the fun of it and starts to hunt down the teenager s friends now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel again it is stupid ever cop would know his face but he walks right by them now he kills two cops outside teenager s house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage if any other profession put out work of this low quality they would be fired yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash 
523,no one can say i wasn t warned as i have read the reviews both user external but like most of us attracted to horror movies curiosity got this cat come on we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room but you know that s horror aficionados are always dying to know what s in there even if we know it ll be bad the bottom line is that this movie left me angry not because it pretends to be real who cares gimmicks are allowed or because the actors and dialogue are so lame is this an unusual event in horror movies or even because the movie is so bad and i am being polite here what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of bwp but also a half hearted lazy rip off at that i don t believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them but they didn t even try the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror or any movie 
534,good lord this movie needs to have a new classification on its cover watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do i am disappointed i was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine but this movie didn t do it a reasonably good story but pretty awful acting dialogue and filming it was disjointed and sometimes outright silly we had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera people talking out loud by themselves and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen shadows of equipment in some shots silly clichés like i just need you to hold me in the totally wrong places and situations thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if i d offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money 
9, warning spoilers although it s hard to spoil this film by telling story details eisenstein s black and white propaganda film is not for everyone it s very old and it s er clumsy what makes it great for me is the soundtrack not the original but the updated soundtrack better still the orchestral version prokofiev created my favorite performance is by fritz reiner and the chicago symphony the film is actually funny in places it s reminiscent of the old midsummer night s dream some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent some of the actors are also quite magnificent the actor who played nevsky could have been a superstar today ditto for the warrior chick vasilisa definitely a rocker this may be the world s best collection on film of pithy russian sayings there are tons of them they make up the bulk of the spoken lines the battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most high budget hollywood flix these guys are as clumsy with their fighting as real peasants would be the weapons look nasty so the actors were probably trying to avoid actually wounding one another the actor playing the german grand marshall is trying really hard to look scary early in the film but he looks like he was really a pussycat after he s captured he looks so pathetic speaks volumes about the intended audience da a really humorous touch is that the german army brings an organ with it played by a character in a black robe watch the russians bring this guy down while he s playing after the battle is over and almost all of the germans are dead comes the best part of the film and the music the song sung to the dead soldiers who ve died defending the motherland this part is so sad it s almost an anti war statement ten times as many men as ladies have rated this film wonder why warning joseph stalin liked this film ironic he killed more russians than anybody those who come to russia carrying a sword will die by the sword 
422,this show lasted for most of the 1980s and had its moments but plots were usually dishwater thin and often painfully unfunny terry scott and june whitfield were wasted in this sitcom they both deserved better but it does provide some fond memories and i have found myself smiling at some repeated scenes june whitfield s talent for comedy is allowed to shine through on occasion when she is not being a foil to terry and she really is clever the 1980s is the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class middle aged comedy and many people remember it fondly but i prefer to remember the decade for alternative comedy and the biting satire of spitting image 
656,this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast and many memorable scenes the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents the spanish characters in the film are played by a frenchman boyer a belgian francen a greek paxinou and a hungarian lorre and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat despite these absurdities the performances are all very good especially those of paxinou and lorre but the scene in which boyer paxinou and lorre meet and talk in wildly different accents is a real hoot and i guess seeing as how they were alone that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway it seems pretty weird that the brothers warner couldn t find any spanish speaking actors in los angeles of course hollywood has often had an any old accent will do policy my other favorite is greta garbo swedish as mata hari dutch who falls in love with a russian soldier played by a mexican ramon novarro maybe they should have got novarro for confidential agent he would have been great in boyer s role or at least in francen s which would have saved greatly on the dark make up budget 
703,while both this movie and the signature car chase have been shown a lack of respect by many critics both are way above average roy scheider does an excellent job playing his best type a tough courageous cop who works hard to get the job done in spite of the desk drivers and politicians who should be supporting him rather than hindering he played a suburbanized version of this same role as the tourist town police chief in jaws not nearly as gritty but the same get the job done despite the politicians and gutsy approach if a man who can t swim and is terrified of everything in the water going out on an old boat with an ahab wannabee and a nerd to confront a huge killer shark isn t gutsy then tell me what is tony lo bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain most of the villains in fact have some depth and complexity this is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings overall it captures the atmosphere of parts of ny city gritty unglamorous often dangerous but filled with energy the story is spare tight and subtle it gets the job done without extraneous elements it may not be one of the all time greats but it is an exceptionally good movie everyone has an opinion about car chases mine is that this one is right up there with the mustang vs dodge charger chase in bullitt the pontiac ventura chevy nova was similar to the mustang in being a compact car chassis with beefed up suspension and a powerful small block v8 stuffed into an engine bay meant for an insipid 6 the ventura novas got little respect off the drag strip but with the proper suspension mods they made affordable performance cars that could handle on both the road and the track the bawling of those gm v8 s as they wind up is music to the enthusiast s ear i ve heard this chase criticized for imitating the bullitt chase the truth is that they are two works by the same master bill hickman who also choreographed and drove for the french connection chase besides driving most of the car chase scenes he created a brooding malevolent presence and a good match with richard lynch as a pair of coldly evil killers yes the chase has realism errors often noted like the use of 3 different ny roads to represent the palisades parkway the ending of the chase in a crash with an 18 wheeler on a roadway for passenger vehicles only and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape harm that s beside the point let s face it movie car chases are unreal by nature in bullitt the french connection and the seven ups however bill hickman and phillip d antoni crafted chases far more realistic and therefore more exciting than the flying rolling exploding vehicle fantasy chases so common in recent films 
445,this film was a yawn from titles to credits it s boring to the point of tedium and the acting is wooden and stilted admittedly this was director richard jobson directing debut but who on earth green lit a script as poorly developed as this one looks like another money down the drain government project scottish screen are credited surprise surprise i nearly fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one please please mister jobson what ever you ve been doing prior to directing this sedative of a film go back to it 
325,the impossibly sexy rosie holotik plays charlotte beale a new nurse at one of those movie type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own unorthodox ways of treating the inmates reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious dr masters anne macadams a k a annabelle weenick the inmates don t take too kindly to charlotte either part mystery part horror this initial effort from b movie director s f brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it these colorful psychos including a nymphomaniac with no self esteem a gentle giant who s already had a lobotomy and a supposed judge who speaks in legalese jargon dominate the screen with their unnerving presence it s a picture that works fairly well establishing the gritty grim atmosphere right from the get go some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality it builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity offering one surreal encounter after another particularly effective is the poetry quoting dotty old mrs callingham for cheap 1970 s era cheese it s pretty effective with a particularly nasty climax i had a pretty good time watching it 7 10
93,i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land in a river runs through it redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot serpent s kiss reigne margot redford s cast is perfect tom skerritt is the rev maclean a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible brenda blythen the mother and his sons craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons and later complex young men both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever it is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent years what makes these relationships special however is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue this is a literate script beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not so implausible in redford s directorial hands given the material redford s ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again 
586,i absolutely loved this movie as a child i can t seem to find it anywhere i was mentioning it to some friends just the other day and not a single one of them remembers it can anyone help me out my older sister vaguely remembers it there was also another movie i remember that was half live action and half animation but i can t remember the name of it the characters were animated and the background was real i seem to remember it being about a kangaroo and i believe the setting of the film was in australia i m going out of my mind trying to obtain copies of these films that were such a memorable part of my very enjoyable childhood edit i searched imdb for this other movie and found out it s called dot and the kangaroo all i had to do was type in kangaroo in the search bar under characters and the name of the movie in the list was like a bell going off man i love imdb thanks 
347,being relatively young i didn t know how bad anti semitism was in brooklyn where my family is originally from this movie absolutely horrified me i ve seen many movies about prejudice racism and anti semitism but this seemed to hit me harder than most this was definitely one of the best indie films i ve ever seen i had to travel 45 minutes to see it and it was well worth it nearly everything about the movie was great sometimes it was a little slow but that didn t really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric it took place in the 40s and it really did look like it was the 40s the acting was great william h macy as always was wonderful so was laura dern and i was pleasantly surprised by meatloaf s performance playing the vicious anti semite neighbor 9 10
159,this columbo episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites the cast includes rosemary s baby john cassavetes as the maestro his wife played by blythe danner gwyneth paltrow s mom and his mother in law played by myrna loy one of america s greatest leading actresses in film of our time anyway i disagree with anybody who criticizes against this film this episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast who do a superb job in performing i love watching columbo with his beloved dog who he never names in the series this time the episode focuses in on classical music at the hollywood bowl one of l a s attractions of course columbo becomes as interested in classical music as he does anything else involving a crime 
840,this is based on michael s life from 1983 4 till 2004 flex alexander did a good performance but looked nothing like michael i feel michael was portrayed as a stupid person which i don t believe he was even though he trusted the wrong people at times i thought flex alexander looked chinese when they made michael look white i think latoya should of been portrayed in this she was always pictured with her brother in the 80 s i never thought any of the supporting cast looked like their counterparts there were some things that were inaccurate lisa marie presley s son looked about 4 in the wedding scene even though he was not yet 2 when lisa and michael got married also when michael says to his mother katherine he thinks he and debbie should marry if she is carrying his child it was katherine s idea for the two to get married 
730,robert lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four dimensional atomic age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci fi in its time with psychological overtones yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive it s a camp fest tailor made for tv s late late show wooden performances by lansing and lee meriwether barely rate as one dimensional though patty duke playing a cute brat pre miracle worker gets a colorful memorable exit from 
225,a throwback to the old fashioned westerns of the 30s and 40s such as dodge city dallas has a number of things going for it gary cooper at his coolest blazing technicolor photography by ernest haller gone with the wind and a pulse pounding max steiner king kong gwtw dodge city et al score in addition there is a masquerade mistaken identity a faked death and more hair breath escapes than a republic serial as always cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure forget the 50s angst western this is pure entertainment 
862,interferencia starts as unemployed martin sanders andres bagg hears something strange on his phone he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named diana arranging to meet her soon after martin reads a local paper sees the front page story about a prostitute being murdered thinks back to what he heard martin confides in his friends laura virginia lustig aaron oliver kolker but they don t believe him then shortly after the same thing happens again the phone call the man the prostitute her death reported in the papers martin decides he has to find the killer put a stop to his killing spree but who is it this argentinian production that was apparently shot in just eight days why so long on a budget of about 3 000 why so much was written directed by sergio esquenazi i cannot believe some of the glowing comments interferencia has on the imdb out of 195 user ratings as i write this 113 of them rate this pile of crap 10 out of 10 i am sorry but there is no way anyone should be giving a film this bad a quite literally perfect score of 10 out of 10 if a score for a film on imdb is fixed then this is it i honestly don t believe that if you showed interferencia to 195 average people that well over 100 of them would rate it as being absolutely perfect no way on earth the user comments are also amazingly positive all by imdb users who have only wrote comments for one film this the one user besides me who has actually written more than one comment gave it a rock bottom 1 out of 10 which sounds just about right everyone is entitled to an opinion but i would stake my life on the fact most of those positive comments are from fake accounts set up purely to big this piece of crap up where do i start how on earth can i adequately describe how bad interferencia is the plot is a mess that basically lives or dies by it s terrible twists while most twists turn a plot on it s head alters the perspective of everything that has gone before in a clever relevant way are genuine surprises here in interferencia the twists destroy the first half of the film makes it utterly pointless in a it didn t actually happen sort of way the twist is so poorly handled that it leaves you asking more questions than it answers what made martin go mad why did he imagine the phone calls why did he imagine a killer why did he imagine the newspaper headlines no explanation is given for martin s behaviour during the first hour or so of the film there s just this absurd revelation that it was all in his mind that s it that s all the exposition there is then there s a plot twist about martin s missing wife her lover before martin for reasons unexplained starts to kill his friends for no apparent reason i am sorry but interferencia is so bad it s so boring it s so badly written thought out that i honestly can t think of a positive thing to say about it sorry guy s but that s how i feel quite simply interferencia is one of the worst films i have ever seen is a complete mess both conceptually technically according to the imdb interferencia was hot in just eight days to be honest it doesn t feel like that at all nope it feels more like it was shot in five days the whole film is an eyesore interferencia has probably the worst nighttime shooting i have ever seen it s like no attempt was made to light the scenes it s like the makers just went into a dark room or basement or whatever just shoot the scene regardless of whether you could see anything the scenes set outside in the daytime have this horrible unnatural blue green tint to them for no apparent reason which just looks daft becomes increasingly irritating this strange tint is not repeated on indoor scenes so they are also quite jarring noticeable there s no real horror or scares in fact i would say interferencia is more of a thriller than a horror as far as gore goes there are two decapitated heads in a fridge a knife is stuck in someones mouth nothing else according to the imdb this had a budget of about 3 000 which makes interferencia one of the lowest budgeted films ever commercially released surely some people think just because a film is low budget all reasonable viewing standards should go out of the window we should accept any old crap wrong to watch this on dvd you will still have to pay good money i personally think we have the right to expect some sort of good product if this can get released praised like it s oscar worthy then we can all release our holiday camcorder footage including embarrassing karaoke footage scenes of total blackness as we forgot to take off the lens cap win top prizes at the next cannes film festival the acting is awful although the female lead virginia lustig is actually rather sexy helps ease the pain of the final twenty odd minutes as she features a fair bit interferencia is an absolutely terrible film seriously i beg you don t be fooled by all the fake positive comments there is no way anyone not involved in this or have some sort of agenda is going to give it a 9 or 10 out of 10 an amateurish mess that is truly horrible to sit through sorry but that s the way i see it sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind you have been warned 
650,featuring some amazing and wonderful characters a new mythology superbly designed and executed sets nightbreed is a great film sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being unwittingly censored by the white audience the film decries none the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie superhero genre a sequel featuring highlander style flashbacks to different epochs in history would be interesting another idea would be the foundation of the new midian perhaps in texas somewhere or the swamps of lousiana with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus 
762,i ve seen about 820 movies released between 1931 39 and the informer is the worst major release i ve seen from that time span awful despicable unpleasant unhappy unredeemable saga of a complete loser watch a 1934 b western instead 
390,just to clarify matthew poncelet wasn t a real person but a character combination of 2 killers who were both convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers i read the user comments and they react as if matthew was real the character is based on a mixture of two killers elmo patrick sonnier and robert lee willie who murdered separate people and the murder itself was based on the one willie committed the conflict of both willie having someone else present and both parties swearing the other did the killing is worked into the story as well prejean s approach is unique in that she not only is ministering to the convicts as they wait for their death and aiding them in taking responsibility for their actions she also reaches out to the victims families to help them know that the convict did indeed feel remorse for what they did effectively aiding both parties everyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs on the death sentence it s not my place to say it s right or wrong in theory punishing death with death makes some sort of karmic sense however denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days although costly makes more sense to me being stuck in a small room 23 7 with one hour of exercise for the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing they did seem a more apt punishment they are technically alive but denied living say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility the person they killed required like susan smith killing her poor kids by shoving her car into a lake i find it fittingly ironic that they would not get that freedom they craved and would now have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned prejean s point comes through the story very well she has my respect she manages to find that balance she isn t supporting a killer she is guiding them to accepting what they did if they didn t feel some kind of remorse they wouldn t be asking for spiritual guidance ona final note when poncelet apologizes to delacroix parent for killing his son the parents of the girl who was also murdered mutters something about why he didn t apologize for her death i think the point was that throughout the movie poncelet denies killing both kids there is doubt in prejean s mind he did both killings there is a friend who was sentenced but not to death my thought is that poncelet killed the delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girl hence poncelet was taking responsibility for what he did had he been responsible for the girl s death he probably would have apologized for that as well 
604,one of my favorite shows back in the 70s as i recall it went to air on friday or possibly saturday night on the nine network here in australia darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great together each episode usually reached a climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent to their credit the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible i remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which who came back as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the power beast amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames oh well you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea mcgavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best definitely deserves a place in tv s hall of fame to quote tony vincenzo kolchack you are on it or in the case of the hall of fame in it 
751,i can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet that is the worse supposibly children s film i have ever seen in my life i took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 mins the sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film they should pay you to watch it not you pay them it s truly truly awful there is no other way to describe it the people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren regards stephen
208,the only footage of zeppelin i ve seen prior to this dvd is the song remains the same movie from 1976 we used to spend hours round a friends house watching this but i never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences so what of this dvd i didn t know it existed until browsing for the physical graffiti cd when did this come out i thoughtfor some reason i thought that page wasn t a great live guitarist but to say that watching this dvd has changed my opinion is a massive understatement there s white summer from 1970 10 minutes of guitar wizardry there s an acoustic set from 1975 bron y aur stomp has a brilliant finger picking improv section the in my time of dying and trampled underfoot performances also from 75 are breathtaking with page and bonham tearing things to pieces like no one else ever has demonic possessions of rawk the magic continues into the knebworth 1979 section the rendition of achillies last stand considering their various drug addled states just beggars belief a song of complex guitar overdubs page arranged it in a way that lets him just punk it out live the effect is totally mesmerising in the evening i never liked this on disc but it zings along here sick again great piece of sleaze rock the footage from knebworth is very interesting cutting between big screen various rostrums and bootleg footage to great effect plant is amazing throughout all the performances page despite being painfully thin looks like a six year old kid having the most fun of his life at the knebworth concert and makes infectious viewing one thing that puzzled me the black dog performance from 1973 sounds very camped up robert plant always did love a little mince and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous and would warrant an arrest nowadays all very different from the muscle bound kick a studio version i love this dvd it has reminded me how good zeppelin were and remain 
237,to put in simple words or rather a word would be best suited by pathetic the movie starts with attracting a little interest by the plot but but as few minutes by audience is getting restless for restrooms and getting snacks or to get a breathe of fresh air outside the closed dark hall it seems like watching a movie from 1960 s where colors were dull directed by a debutant and acted by high school students movie revolves about a american high headed actress trying make a comeback into films by acting in one of the not so great indian movie her acting is real sad complimented by the worse dialogue delivery overall i would not recommend anyone to watch this movie still want to watch then try watching it at home when some tv channel airs it believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single advertisement and no sponsors and better carry a aspirin u might need it if you cant find a remote control to change channel p s i have no clue if the other reviewers even watched the movie i did and wasted my 10 on the ticket 
596,anthony wong plays lok a husband whose wife is seriously ill poor lok due to her illness he has been going without sex for a long time that s why he is plagued by a series of sleazy nightmares featuring nurses and schoolgirls erotic nightmare is a fun cat iii flick loaded with sleaze and voyeurism there is also a bit of gore as the first part of the film shows some nasty killings committed by wong character under the influence of the monk s mystical powers the dream sequences are quite erotic and sleazy so i m not complaining of course those who expect gruesome cat iii horror in the tradition of diary of a serial killer or red to kill will be disappointed but fans of sleazy exploitation cinema should give this one a look 7 out of 10 
752,this is a excellent start to the film career of mickey rooney his talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him the car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era this start of the andy hardy series is an american treasure in my book spring byington performance is excellent as usual please mr rooney or owners of the film rights take a chance and get this produced on dvd i think it would be a winner 
602,a review i have put off for far too long bluntly 2001 is one of the best science fiction films made to date if not the very best stanley kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works and although it is misunderstood by many and respectively underrated it is considered one of the best films of all time and i ll have to agree back in 1968 no one had done anything like this before and no one has since it was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then and seeing how the effects hold up today it is no wonder as to why the film still looks marvelous after almost forty years take note cgi people through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid this aspect alone almost single handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects i can t think of another film where you can t here anything in space like it is in reality not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood and it works flawlessly aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film the music played all classical compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man s journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler the story while seemingly simple is profound sequentially several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film what are they where did they come from what do they do these are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way while most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story each individual will have to decide what it means to them any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions it s not left entirely up to interpretation but in some aspects it is experience it for more clarification the end result is quite chilling no matter your personal solution while it is a long film and sometimes slows down it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man it s not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film faster paced feature those with short attention spans need not apply last but not least is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist hal 9000 the computer never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence which reminds me for a film with such profound ambition and execution there is surprisingly little dialogue another sign of kubrick s genius all in all one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made a personal favorite everyone must see this film at least once very highly recommended 
434,dr chopper starts shortly after teenager nicholas robert adamson mum has died he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at lake tatonka the self proclaimed friendly place for happy people that she didn t tell him about so nicholas together with his girlfriend jessica chelsey crisp three friends jimmy butch hansen reese chase hoyt tamara ashley mccarthy head out there for a fun weekend unfortunately things don t go according to plan the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed their neighbours turn out to be dr chopper ed brigadier his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments going straight to video dvd dr chopper was edited directed by lewis schoenburn this film seems to be having a hard time here on the imdb with some pretty harsh reviews while i think dr chopper as a horror film is pretty worthless i don t think some of the criticism i ve read is entirely justified the script which takes itself very seriously is credited to ian holt whether he likes it or not who has a role in the film as detective crocker according to the imdb cast list although i can t remember any character of that name maybe he was one of the cops at the start anyway the basic story is alright i suppose although it s a tad dull lasts for too long it s typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running around bumping off our annoying american teen cast you know the drill by now besides some brief undeveloped nonsense about dr chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating body there s not much story here the script seems to exist solely to invent situations for girls to take their tops off there s the inevitable sex scenes there s a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless there s even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing oh when i say topless i mean they aren t wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn t any actual full frontal nudity in dr chopper at all so there you have it really it s an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted is populated with poor clichéd dumb character s that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes girls in bras to be honest i expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe i m just being picky director schoenburn does ok actually this is by no means the worst looking film i ve seen although it still looks cheap there s no style here i didn t think it was scary there s no atmosphere either the gore is restrained restricted to some dead bodies severed limbs there s nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects dr chopper is also one of those films where character decisions motivations are ridiculous technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits the acting is alright it could have better but i ve certainly seen worse dr chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn t enough to satisfy me despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace 
992,for the uninitiated almost any andy milligan film is a shock but despite the fact that i ve seen many of his films this one still takes the cake for sheer shoddiness this is of course milligan s take on the sweeney todd tale done with period costumes but not necessarily period hairstyles in some cases and the usual headache inducing camera work grainy quality as for the gore well the version i saw may have been cut some for there s not a lot for a film with bloodthirsty in the title the best indication of subversive film making here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victim s tit so while i will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf it s definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though recommended for only the foolhardy morbidly curious 3 out of 10 
389,the sopranos 1999 2007 number 1 television show of all time everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn t go past a pilot episode the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss tony soprano accompanied by a stellar cast edie falco is superb as the worrying loving upper middle class mother tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious greying consiglieri who is often very funny while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian americans as mafiosi and to an extent this is undeniable i can see so many positives from the show the portrayal of strong family values friendships love and compassion could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters yes furthermore other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism social inequality and injustice homosexuality drugs etc this is no shallow dull show about tough guys and violence it has so much more many of the issues we see on the show are very real the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters lives which makes the whole thing more interesting credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini for envisioning television s most complex and enigmatic character simply exceptional 10 10
400,well after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravo s the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film the plot was simple beautiful model alison parker cristina raines moves into an apartment building that s a gateway to hell the sentinel is a down right creepy film even if it s a bit slow it s a mix of the omen and rosemary s baby the acting is fine and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals it s a very odd campy but in the end i truly believe a great film one of my favorites from the 70 s even if it s nothing greatly original it s wacky and extremely creepy probably one of my all time favorites 9 10
644,this movie is best enjoyed amidst a large audience with the giggle fits very frequently the characters in kadosh are seen staring ahead intensely at nothing very intense unhappy faces very pensive very serious during these moments there is very serious sounding music just to make doublely sure the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games the more entertaining portions of this film come in between the many pensive stares we learn that the women of the kadosh community have two duties one is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands the second is to stay employed so to free their husbands from having to work what do these men do with their ample free time they pray and we learn that at home they pray out loud i give you thanks for not creating me as a woman and at their place of worship they pray to give thanks for possessing functioning male genitalia along with the praying there are many scenes of frenzied antics screaming and endless head bobbing and bodies rocking back and fourth and mixed in with everything are many intricate and bizarre or simple but just as odd ritualistic activities the cream of the unintentional comedy comes from the sex the imagery of an hot and bothered man actively exchanging body fluids with his wife in bed while attempting to keep his beanie from falling off his scalp is unforgettable every sex scene is funny but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against his beautiful wife s yaël abecassis feet oh yes we are finally entering the land of sensuality but no the feet rubbing stops before anything happens and the husband begins his autistic looking head bobbing and body rocking until the scene ends there are three attractive females in near states of undress however kadosh contains absolutely no nudity technically there is some interesting imagery and pleasing uses of light and colors by the director for a more believable educational and entertaining treatment of the plight of being an unclean female unworthy of holding a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed by which a man can cite a phrase from ancient writings i suggest barbra streisand s yentl 
384,not high art not even exceptionally innovative but a thoroughly enjoyable movie funny fresh intelligent there are still people out there who don t need millions of dollars to hide that they re out of ideas when you compare this to your average hollywood action flick you re comparing a homemade meal with a big mac 
157,considering the film s reputation as truly the worst of the worst i was looking forward to watching wood s crappus opus my word it s not necessarily any more inept than the other woods i ve watched however being from the reefer madness 1938 school of film making glen or glenda doesn t come across as readily enjoyable as his genre efforts also this surely emerges as horror legend bela lugosi s nadir his first of three collaborations with the director one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was considering the actor s history of heavy medication and the sheer senselessness of his cameo besides lugosi s idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward here though wood s script is mostly to blame for this given the impossible dialogue with repeated nonsensical allusions to puppy dog tails and big fat snails he handed the ailing star by the way wood himself plays the central role under the pseudonym daniel davis and being just as worthless in this area proves to have been an all round dog dolores fuller his wife and co star was similarly untalented she would also appear in jail bait 1954 but at the very least the image where the latter finally lets glen wear her angora sweater did give tim burton s affectionate biopic ed wood 1994 its famous poster incidentally the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between wood and orson welles well for all intents and purposes glen or glenda constitutes ed wood s citizen kane 1941 given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques in fact the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore many of it irrelevant such as the bewildering instances of s m and inane dream sequences highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make martin scorsese weep with envy the film s sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the affliction phenomenon of transvestism is however sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach for what it s worth the edition i watched was the extended re issue version which included six minutes of depraved footage directed by w merle connell censored on original release furthermore my copy went out of synch every so often which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track though thankfully this was the fault of the source conversion to divx as opposed to the film itself 
32,let s get things straight i was raised catholic and in a very religious family and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home that was useful for two things to make a convinced atheist out of me and to give me deep insightful knowledge about the church and its dogmas and i say if a catholic priest witnesses a murder and clearly sees the face of the killer he can report it to the police even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards he can not reveal what he s told in confession but he can talk about anything he sees outside that and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut so here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie and another lie is there s no absolution for murder according to the catholic church there s absolution for any sin as long as there s sincere repentance so far the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller as people frequently say this movie would have improved if bob hoskins and alan bates had switched roles hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters i will never lament enough that he lost al capone in favor of one of de niro s weakest performances in the untouchables and bates features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past but above that i think the film would have been much better had real life ulster native liam neeson back then mostly unknown to big audiences played mickey rourke s part not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters but he d make us believe the character as real something rourke just can t back in the 80s rourke was not a bad actor afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks but he was one of those performers like brad dourif who s as good as the director he works with and as a former ira terrorist rourke s acting comes across more like a pimp sad to think that had this movie been made just some three to six years later when neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with sam raimi s enjoyable darkman and superstardom in 1993 with schindler s list while rourke became pretty much of a forgotten has been liam and mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of docherty but just can t carry this movie along as the lead yet another missed opportunity and yet another film with the potential of being a classic that became instantly forgettable fare ironically enough the often criticized score by underrated composer bill conti worked for me i didn t find it overly melodramatic but suitably gritty and beautiful it reminded me of howard shore s score for the silence of the lambs here s to mike hodges talent who made get carter yes but don t forget he s the mastermind behind flash gordon as well it seems the film was massacred in the cutting room it shows as some parts are really choppy and confusing and others just don t glue and a director s cut is waiting to see the light ok but i seriously doubt that will make it a great movie as we ll still have the bad casting and the false premise there 4 10 
760,there are subtleties in this film that i think a lot of people may miss if they re not careful you really need to follow what leland says and read his character to figure out the intended why the movie presents at the end nothing it solid it s not definite it s about what the individual viewer takes out of it i think that was the plan from the get go people aren t meant to all understand it in the same way it s almost about forming your own personal relationship with leland in order to maybe feel him a little better the storyline is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is it s dramatic and thought provoking a lot of heavy ideas but the pace of the movie is almost soothing even with its more intense scenes with yelling i think it s probably leland he s just calm and almost serene even for all of his sadness the movie personifies leland in a way of course it is captivating and draws you in if you let it but there are some recycled ideas i mean leland has a lot of impressive dialogue he is anything but typical but he s not a prophet everything he says is not a revelation many people i know have mentioned things he mentioned even i have observed a few things he s observed leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for ryan gosling s portrayal in the end the acting is all exceptional there are no real bad guys there is no way to psychologically evaluate leland only to maybe understand him and life a little better comparable to igby goes down i think not comedic but similar in its general outlook on life 
65,i was blown away by this film i m one of those people who just takes a risk with movies that don t especially appeal to me sometimes and i ve got to say this one paid off i mean wow even my young boys enjoyed the film 5 and 6 at the time though i m quite certain this was not geared to their age groups this movie was clean too which is a great plus it is so great to sit down to a movie you thoroughly enjoy without profanity violence except one very brief scene or anything else one is likely to find morally objectionable this movie brought you along on a journey you are so ready to believe because of the great acting you feel the vast range of emotions portrayed along with the characters i never thought a golf movie would have me at the edge of my seat but i couldn t help being intensely interested in how this one would turn out i have nothing to compare it to since i have neither watched golf in reality or on film before but everyone did a great job in keeping the pace and emotions captivating here the score also did wonders excellent excellent score even if you don t think this would be your kind of film watch it you may be pleasantly surprised i certainly was 
41,in short this movie was awful i understand it s a disney movie which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting however i must say this is the worst of all disney movies with bad acting lots of irritating shrieking teen girls my god and an extremely unrealistic plot even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie the only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store do yourself a favor and change the channel before watching this no matter how bored you are on a sunday afternoon 
518,i haven t seen it in over twenty years oj was the bus driver arte johnson was the tour guide lorenzo was the kidnapper yea lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain a natural i think i watched it back then most for oj who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing but also to see arte johnson i was a little bored that johnson was so serious and yes it shifted plots in reading other posts i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue i was going a stamp if it came on as a late movie i would probably record it to check it out again but i wouldn t be nostalgic over it not yet anyway there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out 
176,tycoon will never be listed as one of john wayne s better post stagecoach film it s good in spots has some fine action sequences in the cave in and also in the flood at the climax but the plot leaves a lot to be desired what we have in tycoon is two men who thoroughly dislike each other and that dislike prevents them from working as a team multimillionaire cedric hardwicke has hired john wayne and james gleason to build a railroad but then he refuses to give them the needed funds to do the job right things get really complicated when wayne falls for hardwicke s daughter laraine day after a night when they have to spend time alone in an inca ruin by convention in south america wayne and day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing happened what should have happened is these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to work out their differences one way or another their petty spites cause some fatalities among wayne s crew but what tycoon is most known for is another piece of pettiness laraine day was married to leo durocher the manager of the brooklyn dodgers when this was being filmed he was a constant presence on the set insanely jealous of john wayne who he thought might be having an affair with his wife nothing to it but he made his wife s life miserable not one of the duke s better efforts 
587,this film is a tour de force from julie taymor who directs and does the stage design and masks no one comes near to matching her imagination on the modern operatic stage since making this film in 1992 she has had much success in film making and in directing musicals one can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to opera one day i would love to see a ring cycle directed by her the current rheingold at covent garden has giants with over sized hands just like the characters in this film the current butterfly at eno uses japanese puppetry coincidence maybe or evidence that taymor s influence is pervasive taymar uses fantastical costumes masks puppets and origami birds to recreate the story of oedipus on a stage set on stilts above a lake red ribbons are a recurring theme they are used as an umbilical chord when oedipus is born they hang down from oedipus s eyes after he has blinded himself in a breathtaking effect they are used to make a crossroads when oedipus s slaying of his father is reenacted by puppets this neo classical opera ballet by stravinsky enjoyed justified obscurity until this film brought it to life the music is uninspired but inoffensive and philip langridge jesse norman and a very young bryn terfel make the most of it the singers are fairly immobile in accordance with stravinsky s wishes min tanaka is the dancing oedipus to langridge s singing oedipus this creates some slight confusion towards the end when dancing oedipus pokes out the eyes of singing oedipus the libretto is in latin but do not worry if your high school latin is a bit rusty there is a helpful narrator who introduces and describes each scene in japanese 
545,it s schmaltzy but then what else did you expect the heroine is cinderella s younger sister complete with wicked mother sister and brother in law the hero if you can call him that is an ineffectual putz and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy the cast settings and wardrobe were all very attractive and i thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was the movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout megon mcdonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of its best moments if you love danielle steel you will love this film if you love archetypal romance you will love this film i did not i was able to sit through it but it was close 
415,as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists we all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world but unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie the fact that this movie won a couple of bafta s shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even worse this movie is so bad i wouldn t even bother renting it from the weeklies section do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth 
554,this is a great movie for all corey feldman fans this movie has a great cast of young actors a group of teens decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash but all goes wrong when a security gaurd gets shot and they take hostages
419,a cheesy b crime thriller of the early 50 the story is droll the characters wooden allison hayes and abbe lane are the only two sexpots that make it an eye catcher but one short shot only a few frames long shows an el train crossing the river on the state street bridge of the 6000 series pullman built cars painted in their original 1950 paint scheme as they were delivered when new in 1950 for traction fans like me that one short take makes the picture worthwhile i think films like this one ulmer s detour d o a with edmund o brien the fugitive with harrison ford and others of the film noir genre big city crime dramas make it interesting if for nothing other than the fact that i know chicago and san francisco intimately and recognize most of the street locations other wise it s a really droll boring film 
272,it s the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others success here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier dracula 1931 and frankenstein 1931 in a germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires in the shape of bats have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims even though shot at universal and at the bronson caves it s a poverty row feature it s not fair to compare it with those earlier more expensively made and superior films from the familiar and exciting chilling music of the main titles which must have been by mischa bakalienikoff through the talky but well done opening sequence we anticipate the arrival of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye to give us a good 30s mystery film unfortunately it doesn t happen that s the disappointment we get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing low budget not enough of dwight frye the overdone presence of maude eburne aunt gussie and the premise for lionel atwill dr von niemann to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant emil robert frazier never made very clear do not watch the technicolor dr x 1932 which also stars lionel atwill and fay wray but as father and daughter before watching this the way i did it s an oscar winner by comparison so watch this one first structurally the vampire bat still isn t that good it plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy besides dr x and mystery of the wax museum both 1932 and co starring fay wray lionel atwill s most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in son of frankenstein 1939 and as moriarity in sherlock holmes and the secret weapon 1943 dwight frye steals all his manic scenes in dracula 1931 as the young lovers melvin douglas and fay wray have a nice kissing scene but that s about it he can be seen in the old dark house 1932 and fay gets dragged around by joel mccrea in the most dangerous game 1930 then there s her 1933 classic screamer too bad more time money and rewrites weren t available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye sadly then this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4 
150,does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by george ede aka father fitzpatrick in the move it had to be you he was talking to charlie and annna in the church as they were leaving if not i will have to rent the movie this was a great movie i also loved serendipity great love story for the soul i met my one true love my soulmate and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it i wasn t ready for that kind of emotional relationship altho we did marry i wasn t mature enough to give as much as i thought i would i got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years he finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry in disbelief about the way it turned out i had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years this movie meant a lot because i am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love i can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of father fitzpatrick rang true for me i know when he has healed enough to trust me again we will remarry don t ever get complacent and take true love for granted it has been the hardest lesson of my life also the music in this movie is outstanding and meaningful this movie is deep and spiritually uplifting true love is worth waiting for if it is meant to be it will no matter what it will happen nothing is impossible even when it s the second time around thanks 
265,other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just wanted to add to the whew comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cook s obviously coke fuelled drumming episode this was a doozy i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance a bit of trivia that i am surmising about cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming most energetically is it too much to suggest that cook s spazzy drumming in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by krupa s work as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier if you watch krupa in ball of fire i think you ll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time 
851,i really have to disagree with guy yardley rees who should he have watched the entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery some of the best ever shot in skye and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole this is not a big budget film rather it is a film that has a strong community feel i can t say how much standard films bore me pushing out the same polished stuff again and again seachd doesn t seem to be about that at all it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film ok so the acting isn t in the style a blockbuster that s because the actors are seemingly real people i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing and at times unusually beautiful seachd really bears a second viewing since there are many threads that become clearer second time around that really do feed into the ending overall the combination of music and at times stunning visuals plus a community approach to the acting and non normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film more of these please 
794,this is the best movie i ve seen since white and the best romantic comedy i ve seen since the hairdresser s husband an emotive beautiful masterwork from kenneth branagh and helena bonham carter it is a tragedy this movie hasn t gotten more recognition 
614,well i guess i know the answer to that question for the money we have been so bombarded with cat in the hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie i admit i thought the trailers looked bad but i still had to give it a chance well i should have went with my instincts it was a complete piece hollywood trash once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good must be good aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long it obviously started with a moth eaten script it s chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor and awful pastel sceneries it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction this is then compounded with yes i ll say it bad acting i couldn t help but feel like i was watching coffee talk on snl every time mike myers opened his mouth was the cat intended to be a middle aged jewish woman spencer breslin and dakota fanning were no prize either but mr myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he s ready to make another austin powers movie f no stars 0 on a scale of 1 10 save your money 
866,watching the preview of armored i thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film thankfully the movie was entertaining suspenseful and realistic there never is the perfect crime and armored showed why the movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals the last hour of the film is very entertaining matt dillon is still a very good actor hard to believe dillon is 50 years of age i would buy this movie i give armored eight out of ten not a christmas movie did i write ten lines yet nope anyways there is not to many action films armored has a lot of excitement in it which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy 
686,thomas capano was not anne marie s boss tom carper the governor was that is the reason the feds became involved he called clinton and asked him to get the feds involved in the case i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day i also read ann rule s book and saw the city confidential segment on a e tom capano was a megalomanic sp an uber controller and a monster he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control when she wouldn t let him do that anymore he killed her the ultimate form of control i think it s a waste of money that he is still alive 
209, the ballad of the sad café worked hard at its image but when it came down to crunch time it was left standing in its own self created dust one cannot image saying this out loud but if vanessa redgrave s amelia were to fight john wayne or even clint eastwood my hard earned dollars would have to go to redgrave her portrayal of amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multi million dollar contracted persona redgrave gave amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hard earned woman from the south to the average viewer this could be construed as annoying but as the film progressed it became her miss amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck it was redgrave s performance as well as her interaction with the other characters that made this film stand tall but not the tallest the others following her performance were needed but not stellar as we moved past the murky cliché image passed on by every set designer hired for the post depression south job the minor characters felt like poster board the image was needed to set the scene but the characters of the town had no other purpose take for example rod steiger s vision of some old wild spoken preacher his scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this off the beaten path town the main two players who surrounded amelia battled with charm for the admirable top scene stealing moment but due to the lacking direction it just seemed faded the most absurd of the two albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line is cork hubbard who plays amelia s cousin who shows up randomly one night his character is never quite defined he lacks true motive and his loyalties remain uncertain he plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us the viewers to question his sanity and honesty can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue flicking your ears and punching your chest and head finally there is the other end of the absurd keith carradine callow s close ups of this tormented man build character but our lack of understanding between him and amelia causes his purpose to flounder these were the characters as cliché southern as they were some stood forward and attempted to create an absurdist period piece and i cannot argue that they failed where ballad of the sad café failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative this film was about amelia and her need for other souls in her life the audience s level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining one couldn t help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to leech off a warm heart cork hubbard s character is never quite understood but we do accept him with brief shots of him and amelia doing small things together it is his idea that transforms from a recluse businesswoman to a bona fide café owner the problem is that director callow never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between cork and redgrave is the man crazy or does he represent all of amelia s family i needed something from callow that brought these two out of the david lynch esquire relationship that they had then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of carradine as amelia s love interest using the technique of a flashback within a flashback we see the two wed but never consummate their love which amelia s anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness why was amelia so angry why was there no connection between carradine and redgrave why was this even in the film with the lack of focus towards these characters s connection the eventual scenes between the two made no sense throw in cork s choice and it just gets completely discombobulated while there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that callow created the inability to transfer his characters from point a to point b i lost focus interest and my care for the characters plummeted when i didn t understand the ultimate question why overall the ballad of the sad café began with a bang but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker my emotional feel of this film swung up and down up and down and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters redgrave did a phenomenal job as amelia and while the other characters outside of the random steiger tried their best i just didn t quite understand who they were their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred i was apathetic director callow seemed to have been lacking importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the scenery which allowed us to focus on amelia or carradine but nothing was explained or developed the film played out with anger discover happiness flashback anger anger anger fade out without the comparative connectors this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera it was a shame because sad café had the promise it just couldn t deliver grade ½ out of 
148,films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all films to me in the hands of an insightful artist who examines all the twisted little details of the mundane the french cinema seems to often be very good at this sort of thing and i love the french cinema this film was about the mundane it didn t have a much of a plot it was just characters who lived in a town very normal people and stuff just happened but it wasn t very interesting stuff and it wasn t examined very insightfully the film did capture a bit of a mood but it wasn t a particularly captivating mood and while i can t think of much that the film did specifically wrong it failed on just about every level to do anything right there were a lot of characters in this film a lot of them kind of looked alike so it was hard to figure out who was who and what were their relations to one another i don t mind putting some effort into understanding a film or even watching an especially complex film more than one time to iron out the details but this one was a puzzle not worth the solving for me the only good thing i can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasant functional not brilliant but pleasant the camera often captured some nice postcard type shots but it rarely found the really interesting little details i ve seen a handful of not so good films so far at the seattle international film festival but this was the only one that failed to get any applause when the credits rolled i sensed a big collective sigh of relief when the film was finally over but i suppose there are probably some people out there who would like it 4 10
168,time does extraordinary things it s the ultimate judge time has granted married to the mob an extra doses of freshness there aren t any dead moments or cheap shots it s more of a delight now than it ever was michelle pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that it s as far away from a caricature as anything she s ever done a true original creation touching or hinting at the stereotype just to guide us through but her angela is quite unique the legendary dean stockwell presents us with a a mafia boss that it s just as menacingly real as he is hilarious and matthew modine why did i think back then that he didn t have any chemistry with pfeiffer i was wrong they are wonderful together they reminded me this time to the barbara stanwyck fred macmurray of remember the night i m writing this comment now to entice you to visit or revisit this jonathan demme gem 
950,for this movie based off of a tv show and a serious finale i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious m a s h goodbye farewell and amen was pretty good but not this one unless you really love the series like myself skip this movie i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens but the plot was too gimmicky and dave coulier man that guy hasn t done anything good well ever they shouldn t have used tim meadows he s a great actor but he was too good for the script i thought the movie was pure cheese i would give it a 4 5 10
126,why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie burt reynolds peaked then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero and here loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and 48 hours with this family adventure flick which is an unbelievably tedious childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis s great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film the story is pure humdrum it concerns social worker murphy contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one chosen for what i hear you ask his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world as the main demon classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film but hey i m sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents of all murphy s films this is easily the worst i ve read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role in a non formulaic kind of film and while both points are loosely true there s no forgiving the fact that the film however atypical and non formulaic it might be is an absolute load of garbage 
843,i know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the film makers but it just won t do as a film about vietnam viet nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day in and day out this film stars gene hackman who is korean war vet assigned to train a group of rag tag viet nam vets for a return trip to that country to rescue a group of american pow s held at a camp there these men include a former tunnel rat a crazy acid dropping sailor a blond tanned surfer from california and some inexperienced kid patrick swayze who just so happens had a dad that was killed in nam they train first at some camp in texas and once in nam they are found out and lose all their weapons they are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men most of the men are found and saved but the rag tag group is mostly wiped out this movie played like a video game in which you could figure out what was going to happen next and who would pop out of behind what bush and who was going to die and who was going to live viet nam i m guessing was not like a video game 
969,outstanding film of 1943 with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943 encounting treachery around them lukas successfully deals with the situation he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn like shedding of tears when they must part resolute she knows that her older son must follow him on his path to liberty a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe 
947,when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow 1 the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens what who how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst 2 the van will break down 3 whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about 4 they will find a house inhabited by a madman he will capture them 5 the house will have a phone but it will not work it will be disturbingly decorated there will be flickering neon light spiders and maggots 6 the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won t start here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor 7 the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap weak scare and will then be killed properly 8 only a girl will be left alive from the group 9 there will be an unnecessary twist at the end add to these elements naked sirens who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately that seduce and kill the teens throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film darkhunters which is one of the worst films i have ever seen at times the cinematography is very good the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity however the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again but amongst the dvd extras if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director s commentary it is beyond belief there is more to say about this than the film itself one staggering part of the commentary is the director s claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if people will get it i m afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question what was the point this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies any attempt to do something clever or different haven t worked the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use however the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary there is a simple distinction to be made here mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant the best moment is reserved for robert s comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film those who didn t like it are generalised as geeks and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn t singled out for ridicule the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers complete with hilarious accents to imply that people from norway wouldn t know a good film simply because of where they are born as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast robert s swears blind in voice over i didn t want to make a film that was like baywatch as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground there is also a simpering self indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert s says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is the best british film in years i don t know who he is trying to convince at one point in the commentary track robert s says jokingly i can see people sitting at home saying this isn t amazing its sh t he isn t wrong 
101,i just finished watching this film for me the most outstanding work in this film was the music score while many silent film scores work very well with their scenes i feel that this is the best score i ve come across the mutiny scenes in particular worked extremely well 
80,dresden had great expectations because of its spectacular theme and its high budget i was really looking forward to it and i really wanted it to be good but it is not the only good thing are the special effects that are very well done but like in a really bad hollywood blockbuster everything else is missing it is poorly written the screenplay tries to fulfill genre rules with standard suspense love story elements but there is no depth or originality at all it s way below average the next thing it is also poorly directed it has this uninteresting tv directing style with lots of close ups and wanna be great action by fast editing where actually no action or suspense is the actors are not bad but there is no performance that is touching in any way i don t know they obviously try to do a typical tv movie and not a film for the cinema where its alway good to have some edges and a clear visual style but why do they try to fulfill typical commercial hollywood rules it really feels like the screenwriter did a weekend class with some american scriptwriting guru and then delivered this mess is there no producer who is responsible for the project who has an interest in dramaturgy visual style or plain in simple this magical cinematic moments that make some tv movies great do they think that an tv audience is stupid and doesn t need to get a high quality movie experience the downfall was a very good example for a good tv movie but there was probably some executive or producer who knew what he was doing don t waste you time with this one rent downfall instead 
196,a train holding union soldiers is transporting 300 000 of gold along with a banker clayton who s there to see it reaches its destination but it s suddenly robbed by the bandit monetero however bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it but when monetero tries to get it out of him he s killed by soldiers the only clue is that of a medallion but monetero is captured and soon would be executed a stranger dressed up as a priest comes by who after the bounty of monetero and offers to save his life for half of the gold in exchange monetero gives him half of the medallion but clayton notices it and discovers something is up soon all three are crossing each other for the gold but also the bank s insurance company and monetero s gang are watching on waiting for their chance to pounce just watching the opening sequence you ll know you re in for a spaghetti western with a tongue in cheek style and a reliance of sprinkling many references some nicely realised from other films largely the dollar trilogy of its sub genre director enzo castellari s sprightly direction is sprawling and mostly lightweight but there s potential in many of his grand showy set pieces and smooth rhythmic pace largely there s a lot of tussles fist fights and plenty of acrobatic stunts taking place compared with all out vicious shootouts however most of these stunts are very well done and very enjoyable and when the guns are blazing there s energy to burn the traditional story sticks close to conventional details but since there s a lot of conniving and outfoxing going on the spontaneous nature makes sure you re never quite certain how it s eventually going to play out between the three this leads up to many effective suspenseful moments clever twists and plenty of wink wink the humour within the starch script is pretty sly worked in favourably amongst the light and zesty style is giovanni bergamini s dynamically taut framing and francesco de masi s impulsively rousing music score the performances are extremely well tailored and form a striking rapport george hilton s wry and scuffed turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger gilbert roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable mexican bandit monetero edd byrnes gives a poised performance as clayton that holds up well kareen o hara doesn t get much to do but is a worthy looker gerard herter pedro sanchez and ivano staccioli provide able support a fun and worthy spaghetti parody homage that throws one curve ball after another and many fruitful down n dirty antics 
255,this movie appears to have designed as a fred astaire ginger rogers film the plot outline dance numbers zippy music and the entire formula is there except for ginger whether it really was originally intended as a re pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films instead of the usual sidekicks for fred such as eric blore or edward everett horton burns and allen are used probably since despite being known as a comedy team they could sing and dance quite well this actually shocked me but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional fred and ginger numbers were done with either fred and gracie or these two along with george only once at the very end does ms fontaine dance with fred but it s very brief and with a distant camera shot and speaking of burns and allen i think i owe it to the team to talk about them in the film i have never been a fan of their show or their movies in general i find gracie s idiot act very annoying and i have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full length films however in this film i must admit that they were great not only dancing competently but i actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by edward everett horton very nicely they were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department now as for the rest of the film it s all a lot of fun and is entertaining the problem for me though was that joan fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie not just because she was acting outside her range after all she wasn t a singer or dancer but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint because of this the usual balance and great boy girl dialog was lacking there was also a very charming performance by harry watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupid all because he wanted to win a bet and finally i loved the fun house and tunnel of love sequence it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch overall i did like the film quite a bit it had a lot of charm and excellent writing unfortunately it also featured a bland performance by ms fontaine that knocks off a point bringing my score for this film to 7 
749,to start with i have done some further research on the film firslty jules dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film secondly this was a very low budget film created in the rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir thirdly the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is an actual jewelers the producers of rififi asked them to film their surprisingly i quote jules dassin in a recent interview on the subject surprisingly for some not very obvious reason they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop it s impeccable characters and plot fit in so beautifully with their surroundings to add on to my praise i will say this some might say that this was a typical hollywood film on the contrary this set the base for the regular plot of a hollywood crime film laslty i would like to say that i support this fresh idea of a film where not only one side wins and that side doesn t always have to be the good one for once i can say that a film is not predictable ten stars 
731,one of the worst shows of all time the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the bad ass girl who are these actors never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show the stories were as unbelievable as the actors lame would be the best way to describe it somehow this show makes a slug like ice t more believable as a cop and he wrote the worst song about cops ever recorded 
689,in her first nonaquatic role esther williams plays a school teacher who s the victim of sexual assault she gives a fine performance proving she could be highly effective out of the swimming pool as the detective out to solve the case george nader gives perhaps his finest performance and he is so handsome it hurts john saxon is the student under suspicion and although he gets impressive billing in the credits it s edward andrews as his overly protective father who is the standout bathed in glorious technicolor the unguarded moment is irresistible hokum and at times compelling drama 
139,this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was going to get up and leave at tape 4 but i stuck it out i now consider myself a masochist afghanistan come on guys who s the idiot who forgot to hide the sanskrit billboards i thought the lead actor george calil was particularly inept apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake i thought using the events of 9 11 as a reason to make larson the lunatic implodes all over a screen near you disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9 11 using a phone call from larson s wife sarah supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day was appalling the camera shake didn t make me feel sick that cold hearted stunt did 
474,trying to conceive of something as insipid as the sentinel would be pretty difficult the problems are many the result is terrible and loaded with plot holes michael douglas stars as pete garrison a secret service agent who took one for reagan during the attempt on his life years later we find pete assigned to the whitehouse family mainly as a guard for the first lady kim basinger l a confidential troubles arise as we see pete s close involvement with the first lady and a sudden threat against the president himself david rasche united 93 when pete fails a polygraph test he s singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator david breckinridge kiefer sutherland 24 tv series as the presidential assassination plot unfolds pete finds himself on the run from his own people his only confidant is the first lady and she s reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another which is why pete failed the polygraph in the first place but is pete really innocent or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the president if he is innocent how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the secret service the one big overwhelming problem with this film is that there s no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat isn t that what the movie s supposed to be about one would think so but the audience is never let in on why the assassin s want to kill the prez hmm someone forget to put that in the script somewhere and what s with david breckinridge s kiefer s new partner jill marin eva longoria carlita s way seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of a candy what was her purpose again did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a low cut blouse there are so many problems with the basic premise of the sentinel as to be laughable the action is too easily stymied by the what the responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie 
991,there s some very clever humour in this film which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors however after a while it just seems an exercise in style notwithstanding great gags such as balasko continuing the part of dussolier and very good acting by all involved and i was wondering why blier made this film all is revealed in the ending when blier directing claude brasseur gets a phone call from his dad bernard blier from heaven and gets the chance to say how much he misses him an effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt but there isn t really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it s entire running time some really nice scenes and sequences however and anyone who likes these mosntres sacrés of the french cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film 
83,if you are viewing this show for the first time you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality colorful and imaginative characters entertaining dialogue plots that seem to have some depth to them even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times i mean this is a syndicated children s show right this is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as pokemon pepper ann mighty morphin power rangers and vr troopers please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese exports courtesy of the fox network and saban entertainment don t worry you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s some examples of this period would be transformers garfield and friends captain power and c o p s a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox besides these prime examples disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids coming up with a lineup called the disney afternoon aside from a dumbed down show called the gummi bears early shows like darkwing duck duck tales and chip n dale s rescue rangers gave credence to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like the little mermaid beauty and the beast the rescuers down under and the great mouse detective but above all these wonders shines talespin the premiere of plunder and lightning was a two hour thrill ride and won an emmy much to my delight the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere while i enjoy the plots and dialogue i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters there s rebecca cunningham an independent female but still fallible kit cloudkicker full of pre teen angst and optimism louie with his loyalty and support frank wildcat the most entertaining engineer since scotty on the original star trek molly cunningham cute and witty but with some depth that most child characters don t have and of course in the middle of it all there s baloo whom i would describe as a slobby version of james bond this is because whenever there s trouble baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker than most fastest of all sea duck read james bond s aston martin of course every great show has to have great villains and talespin doesn t disappoint here either from the megalomania of businesstiger shere kahn to the vain and always failing air pirate don karnage to the hilarious and inept soviet satirized thembrians the animation is good the music appropriate and the episodes are for me the finest that children s programming has ever had to offer great fun for the whole family 
353,why can t more directors these days create horror movies like the shining there s an easy answer to that modern day directors are not stanley kubrick kubrick proved once and for all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time so the plot is fairly simple a man named jack torrance played brilliantly by jack nicholson and his family move into a large secluded hotel to watch over it for the off season the kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls what follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie but you have to watch it to see what i mean this is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as scary it s some seriously messed up stuff but in a good way one of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music music has been a major part of kubrick s movies 2001 a space oddysey and a clockwork orange just to name a couple and he definitely doesn t disappoint with this one the score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it finally i must comment on nicholson s legendary performance jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer in fact just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie this is top notch acting that must be seen to believe there will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one r i p stanley 
746,i caught this on ifc last week and i thought it was typical of the indie short subject film heavy on style little on substance and originality does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive and blond to boot boy with 70s shag hair and too cool for school clothes plus this film wallows in late 1970s chic which works for some sofia coppola s the virgin suicides comes to mind but not for this director another reviewer compared this to harmony korine s work and i agree yet i don t view this as a positive thing what has he done lately anyway bobbycrush is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved if you happen to see it late night on cable turn the channel and watch something else instead 
198,goodnight mister tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised it isn t completely faithful to the book but does it have to be no not at all john thaw is mesmerising as tom oakley his transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised making it more believable than scrooge in christmas carol after inspector morse this is thaw s finest hour he was matched earnestly by a young nick robinson who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with his mother the script and music made it worth the buy and you also see thaw playing the organ amazing the most moving scene was willie finding out about zak s death and then tom telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina buy this you ll love it 10 10 bethany cox
595,david burton richard chamberlain quite good is a lawyer more adept at handling corporate taxation and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlie nandjiwarra amagula uses a death bone to stop his heart meanwhile revolving around david bizarre weather patterns effect sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rock sized hail during bright blue skies with no sights of clouds such as the one that hits a school in central australia not to mention a deformed rainbow which is split into groups as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize one aboriginal named chris david gulpilil appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial he finds that it s quite possible after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it s story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable with peter weir in charge the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization but the film s most compelling angle is certainly david s journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly at first to help his men get off from a crime they didn t commit and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later 
507,look if i were interested in a nancy drew book what i would do is pick up a book and read it i m not ever since i can remember i read people trashing movies because it wasn t like the book i m sorry in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books however i m sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form when lord of the rings came out people complained when the third one won an oscar the book was better when i watched to kill a mockingbird the book was better now a bunch of people are upset yet again because nancy drew wasn t like the book i m not saying nancy drew is going to win any oscars if anything it ll be one of those nickelodeon blimps or kids choice awards i m saying give film a break it s film not paper as a movie i found nancy drew quite enjoyable featuring cameos from bruce willis and adam goldberg the hebrew hammer and supporting roles featuring tate donovan jimmy cooper on the o c and rachel leigh cook she s all that this is the first time i ve seen emma roberts in a movie and frankly i enjoy her work more than most of julia and of eric s her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict a lighthearted movie in the spirit of harriet the spy is nice now and again i give it ten stars because i thoroughly enjoyed the movie would love to see it again and will probably buy it upon dvd release 
878,i wait for each new episode each re run with anticipation the new look of sci fi created by stargate sg 1 is a wonder that i hope will never end to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me season 9 should be a thrill in itself i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o neill the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner season after season you cancel this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake also you need a bigger role for the asgard they are just too cool 
30,very interesting to find another reviewer who had the exact same reaction to this movie as i did it was a heck of a lot better when i was 10 or 11 years old seeing it more than 30 years later it s still okay but it only mildly held my interest what seemed hugely funny back then was only mildly amusing also things that were astonishing to me as a 10 year old came across as just silly for example in one scene trinity is walking along and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking in fact he doesn t even bother to look and see if they re dead because he knows he hit the mark um yeah right in addition a lot of the dialogue sounds quite wooden sorry but 35 years later it hasn t really aged that well although it s been a long time since i ve seen that one as well probably a better terrence hill film than this one would be my name is nobody 
468,mindless dribble about the second coming of christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking sandra locke you have no idea what s happening on the screen with the irritating theme song suzanne being played over and over throughout the movie until when the second coming of suzanne is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing this off the wall armature movie maker logan jared martin is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project planning to go on his own logan then spots this couple at a seaside café and is fascinated with the young woman suzanne sandra locke who reminds him of someone he knew in another life jesus christ with logan s assistant and all around gofer clavius richard dreyfuss somehow getting a 740 000 00 loan from the bank to finance logan s masterpiece he starts to work on suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film this leads to suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist simon paul sand but later simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out the movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub plots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl dorothy kari avalos who s cured of her autism by suzanne after everyone else at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to failed it s not really known what exactly suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there was this supposed to show us in the audience that she like jesus could miraculously heal the sick there s also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon jackson sinclair gene barry who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid life crisis or has seen a biblical like vision that changed his life forever sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it s all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there s all this suffering in the world like this movie that he s in and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on suzanne sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur david mark rasmusser who s gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the pacific coast the movie the second coming of suzanne goes on with a number of unrelated sequences probably to fill or pad in some time by it s director and film editor and then goes to it s final scene in a christ like crucification on a hill as logan has all the cameras rolling it turns out that the crazed logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate on the helpless and tied up suzanne the actual crucification of jesus christ some 2 000 years ago hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow the second coming of suzanne puts you through the same kind torture that suzanne is put through by logan and the makers of the film the movie tries to be arty but that s just an excuse to cover up it s brainless and non existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it 
59,this is a beautiful film the true tale of bond between father and son this is by far tom hanks at his finest tom hanks is really out of the box in this movie he usually has the nice guy roles yet in this film he comes off in this film as a bit gritty but still emerges smelling like a rose even until the very last scene the assassination of his character the cast of this movie was well put together i also love the part when there is total silence when tom hanks character shoots and kills all of the men in mr rooney s group there is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene just simply emotion i love the look on john rooney paul newman s character s face when he realizes even before seeing him that it is tom hanks s character getting revenge and he knows his fate has come the first time i saw this movie i was blown away and knew i had to go out and get the video and i since have adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies tom hanks is my favorite actor so this film has a special place in me 
506,i myself feel this film is a rare treasure not only is it the beginning of shirley temple s career but a rare look on how our society has changed you have to understand certain things we today would view as sexual back then would be considered innocent for example the parents of the children in the film as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie saw this as just children mimicking adults most people didn t think of anyone viewing children sexually attractive other than teenage boys lusting over teenage girls to them it wasn t sexual mind you this was before we had internet tv etc most sex crimes weren t openly brought up occasionally there would be a whisper about the kid with the funny uncle but that was often all that came of it yes very sad but it is kinda sad today for even i too can see this film as anything other than what it was intended innocent and funny when i saw shirley dance like that and the boys eye balling her yes i felt disturbed i have to remind myself the time this took place those children didn t know what sex was the parents knew that both those of the children in the movie and those watching it the thought may not have even entered their minds in the eyes of the average adult back then this was no more sexual then if shirley was playing house even today kids will enter beauty contest many dressed up extremely maturely for a three yr old however the child is merely pretending i don t blame the child for wanting to act like an adult or the old movies that display this in all honesty our media has made a lot of things seem back then seem sick and wrong this sometimes can be for the best but i truly believe this movie isn t one of them it gives a rare look of an innocent mentality that we have long lost 
732,ok so maybe it s because i m from the north east of scotland and i talk just like the guys in this film but i found this great fun cheap fun to be sure but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all i was actually quite effected when they died in particulare when the captain finally fell the script well it s a game of 2 halfs the opening half of the film is well written and sharp the last half hour is not so great with many questions left unanswered this will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me but nevertheless good fun and a very smart first feature from sturton 
56,when the italians and miles o keeffe work together nothing can go wrong as ever miles is great as the almost as great ator the most lovable barbarian of all times totally lives up to the first movie 
435,one should not be too critical about the director s second feature i really like the camera work of madiba as mr shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at things however howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images remember he has not got any education of any sort i don t think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos worse still madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14 any way if you overcome above mentioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work 
909,i can t believe that the city of muncie is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there this show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law enforcement officers i have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life if they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say it is reality is nothing short of a lie i only saw it once and was appalled at what i saw i wanted to see the little guy get into a foot chase with a bad guy what a joke that would have been nothing on the show was even close to the real world the city of muncie the police chief and all the officers should be hanging their heads in shame and should never want o admit they come from that city no wonder it didn t stay around on tv
937,when i borrowed this movie from a friend thankfully i did not buy it on the package which truly looked bad and ugly was printed the ultimate vampire horror after watching it i thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself the story begins when a teenager surprise is chased by some vampire zombie creatures lighting sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday video on a ten year old vhs system if not worse i gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the promo t shirts looked kind of cool i don t want to dis film students or splatter movies generally but i ve seen braindead and i ve seen a 20 dollar budget movie from students that was ten times better than this crap 
217,in the wasteland that hollywood productions have become of late this movie in and of itself is truly manna from heaven in what could best be described as a cute movie approximately 350 years of movie acting experience allright give or take 100 years joyously lights up the screen to tell a tale of deceit remorse and redemption about a catholic family in buffalo ny truly well positioned to take its place in the feel good movie genre this quiet little independent film by the burton sisters five sisters productions company will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart all while renewing your faith in mankind from the spectacular opening scene shots of buffalo ny to the final credits the film manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family anywhere yet somehow this particular gathering of family and family by association in a small non descript house in buffalo more than fits the bill if you ve never been to buffalo you ll leave the theater with thoughts of shuffling off for a visit shots of the city landmarks and surroundings help to bring a quaint down to earth tone to the film which suits it just fine the quiet beauty of the queen city of the great lakes compliments rather than detracts from the tale that is being told if only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country s second cities instead of running off to a soundstage somewhere the end results would be so much more believable great performances by shirley jones frank gorshin wendy malick jill eickenberry and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent outlasts hollywood s flavor of the week any time go see this movie you ve wandered in hollywood s desert for too long 
410,i had read up on the film and thought it would be cute a feel good saturday night movie i wasn t expecting anything great figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised the dialogue was pitch perfect most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely ash christian was perfect his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see he could have turned this character into something we ve all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character it was wonderful to see jonathan caouette again i didn t know what he would do after tarnation ashley fink is gem a great young character actress that hopefully will get more work there are moments in the film that could have used some work but all in all not a bad time at the cinema my friend described it as a gay angus napoleon dynamite but it s something more than that it s a character study into what it s like to grow up gay in a small town the pain is there but the humor behind that pain that only age can make clearer is magnified i look forward to seeing more of ash christian ashley fink and jonathan caouette soon 
982,although i had previously watched this one some time ago on italian tv i found it to be a surprisingly tolerable potboiler this time round buoyed by an international cast of familiar faces including a bemused joseph cotten as the baron and contrary to many another film of the euro cult sub genre an incident packed plot in place of lethargic pacing the creature itself looks a bit dodgy and cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an eager scientist still dabbling in creating life forms out of corpses one would have thought that he would have made himself an army of them by now and not struggling at perfecting his technique still but ms neri does look good in and out of costume and reliable herbert fux probably comes off best as a lecherous grave robber blackmailer 
852,spoilers following i picked up the book evil angels when it first came out knowing nothing of the case just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain s guilt the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors and picked up by the press of the arterial spray the actelone plates dr james cameron s certainty that the collar was cut with scissors that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up bloody hand print etc all quite convincingly after all these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn t apparent to me at all it was also highly technical evidence difficult for a layman to understand to this point beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didn t believe it was possible the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists whose origins made them appear to be a cult and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt were it not for dedicated selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony finding azaria s clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail the book shook me for that reason and i ve been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone s guilt ever since excepting oj of course i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don t think it could have been done better i ve always liked sam who i could identify with completely and meryl was perfect as always beautiful photography haunting music i think it s not only a very good but a very important movie too bad it didn t receive more publicity at the time it was released 
14,gregory peck s brilliant portrayal of douglas macarthur from the battle of corregidor in the philippines at the start of the pacific war largely through to his removal as un commander during the korean war offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities certainly the most controversial american general of the second world war and possibly ever macarthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions he claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace yet he obviously glories in war he consistently denies any political ambitions yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the president of the united states he shows great respect for other cultures particularly in the philippines and japan and yet is completely out of touch with his own country all these things are held in balance throughout this movie and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man although one is left with no doubt that macarthur sincerely and passionately loved his country and especially the army he devoted his life to peck s performance was as i said brilliant to the point actually of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film which is perhaps appropriate given who he was portraying with the possible exception of ed flanders i though he offered a compelling look at harry truman and his attitude to macarthur sarcastic repeatedly referring to macarthur as his majesty angry frustrated and finally completely fed up with this general who simply won t respect his authority as president marj dusay was also intriguing as macarhur s wife jean devoted to her husband whom she herself referred to as general although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one i very much enjoyed this movie although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about macarthur s early life i have always chuckled at macarthur s reaction to eisenhower being elected president he ll make a fine president he was the best damn clerk i ever had which seems to sum up what macarthur thought the role of the president should be especially to his military commanders during wartime well worth watching 8 10
44,love trap is a must see independent film when i sat down to watch the movie i came in with low expectations but left with a blessing the story is poetic substantive and creative the writer pulls you in further and further which each scene allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that every one can identify with the movie allowed me to reflect on my life and what i consider love to be the movie displayed what love really is action not emotion i was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie the entire presentation surpassed my expectations i give the movie two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and all backgrounds 
279,antonio margheriti s danza macabra castle of blood is an eerie atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts it looks absolutely beautiful in black white and it has wonderfully creepy gothic vibe alan foster is an english journalist who pursues an interview with visiting american horror writer edgar allan poe poe bets foster that he can t spend one night in the abandoned mansion of poe s friend thomas blackwood accepting the wager foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins the film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me the crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable barbara steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter elisabeth blackwood castle of blood is easily one of the best italian horror movies made in early 60 s a masterpiece 
195,surprisingly good early effort from alfred hitchcock one of the only original screenplays written by hitchcock himself this film shows remarkable story structure it kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ one round jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter the movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between jack his girl and the professional boxer the rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men this time for the heavyweight crown even in this early film hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement an armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness the only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927 the final match as a result ends up being somewhat anticlimactic the story though is what carries this film through 
128,what a preposterous story murder blackmail child sex allegations gays and the catholic church absolute tripe how is it that most uk based tv dramas sit coms etc have to include the obligortory gay its really getting tiresome now everybody accepts that there are gay people in society just has there are other minority groups but we don t want it ramming down our throats i ll pass on this one in every single show apart from the above the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story into a pantomime the priest was a paedophile and there are gays running about every where oh yes just to be totally pc one of the gay couple was black i am surprised at c ecclestone for even contemplating this when he read the script 
254,wow i forgot how great this movie was until i stumbled upon it while looking through the garage it s a kind of strange combination of a bio of michael jackson a collection of musical vignettes and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids the vignettes are good especially speed demon but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment in which michael jackson turns into a car a robot and finally a spaceship and it s just as weird as it sounds joe pesci is hilarious and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout the real gem however is the incredible smooth criminal video which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone 
889,i just watched this movie by mistake what a little gem this film made in 1956 looks and feels like a late seventies movie and is in fact better more restrained and correct than say blue soldier the environmental anthropological undertones are way ahead of its time the understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic much more than dances with wolves the last hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo killing fields of the late 1800s probably because those in the movie were real killing fields the movie was shot during legal forestry directed buffalo culls so the animals you see are really being shot the bones are real in conclusion a very under rated western masterpiece superbly acted directed and shot

723,years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me the atmosphere of the movie was first class the acting memorable and the storyline a classic recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part 1 again i looked eagerly to viewing part 2 i was so pleased to realize early on into part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii wrong i wish i d stopped at ii the storyline was not good it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story the characters were weak especially the daughter pacino s protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather 1 or 2 then scenes such as corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting where the goodies get away and everyone else is shot daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board the pathetic shooting on the steps corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes a man of his intelligence and guile isn t ready for an emergency no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again but i ll watch 1 2 many times down the years 
890,zarkorr is one bad movie this doesn t even rate in the so bad its good category it s just bad from the lack of set design to the acting to the special effects everything about this movie stinks for starters the film looks like it was filmed in just empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look good then we get acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like it was an oscar candidate and to top it all off there s the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them off in their garage the towns that the monster is supposedly crushing look like my nephew s train set so obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer the only good thing about the movie is the monster suit its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film and maybe a decent script would have helped too 
70,don t quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldn t have been much comedy i also don t think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesn t change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic i d say but happy it s a light hearted movie with a feel good ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and i m glad they didn t show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly 
825,this film infuriated me for the simple fact that it was made only because shepherd was gay the men who murdered him are clearly wicked what happened to the poor man was truly horrible and a tragedy however where was hollywood when four religious white kids were executed after being forced to perform a host of sex acts on their killers and each other by two evil black men in wichita just two years ago the celebrities only mug for the camera when it serves a political purpose also laramie is portrayed in a poor light by this pseudo documentary which of course is hardly surprising because they are the backward hicks who must be educated by omniscient and enlightened californians still it s always a treat to see laura linney 
464,it s a cooking competition show americanized it s not going to be the japanese version the show is great i could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch from the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman truly a good way to spend some time watching tv you could critique the show for having guests like marc ecko as a judge but meh it s entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize oh yeah and i m bitter john besh isn t the new iron chef ala cuisine 
785,hartley on low key form martin donovan born to play jesus comes as messiah to millenial manhatten p j harvey is excellent as sidekick magdelena a slight film but drily amusing short and sweet 
409,this is a generally nice film with good story great actors and great songs the cinematography was unfortunately bad one of the film s weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from pretty woman why does it hurt to attempt some originality abbas mustan anyone the film is about a newly married couple raj and priya salman rani priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother who will carry their child they pick madhubala a vulgar prostitute played by preity zinta the film is not really realistic i mean isn t it easier to adopt and even if they pick a girl does it mean the man has to sleep with her have you heard of insemination anyway i guess if the writers had heard of all this the film wouldn t have been made so the concept is apparently intentional salman acts very well it s nice to see him playing a serious character but his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman come on it s cheesy and unrealistic rani is just about ok she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by preity zinta the film belongs to preity who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance she makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally she lives the film emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time partly because of her role partly because of her magnetic and positive personality this is one of her career best performances there is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries she just should do more such roles the film s ending only highlights what i said above it is tear jerking exciting and very well acted watch it for preity 7 10 for the film 10 10 for preity 
413,don t get me wrong goldeneye was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise but the series had fallen into a fps rut enter everything or nothing which puts bond in third person when i wrote my earlier review for from russia with love i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise eon definitely is superior in terms of in depth controls and gameplay variety missions range from standard running and gunning to driving an suv driving an aston martin driving a limousine that is wired to explode commandeering two different types of tanks a la goldeneye riding a motorcycle flying a helicopter repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires and free falling after a plummeting damsel sure vehicle controls are a little clumsy but the issue here is the variety as movie adaptations goldeneye and frwl were all that i could have hoped for but eon s original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe shannon elizabeth heidi klum and misaki ito judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q respectively and pierce brosnan while no sean connery adds credibility to the game s proceedings all characters resemble the stars with the disappointing exception of heidi klum who s in game model doesn t do the real life model justice mya s theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies willem defoe s character is a former colleague of christopher walken s baddie from a view to a kill richard kiel appears as jaws the hulking henchman from the spy who loved me and moonraker in three fight scenes the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have single player gameplay mainly consists of standard on foot missions as bond like bond you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth with plenty of wall and object cover unfortunately unlike frwl only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging so bond may end up crouching low when he s supposed to be peeking around a corner and vice versa the game also allows players to go into bond reflex mode while you browse your inventory everything around you will go into super slo mo allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with while this takes some getting used to eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular bond moments such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath and greatly add to the bond movie feeling there are 3 available difficulty levels operative agent and double oh on operative you can breeze through in a few hours on agent a few weeks on double oh a few months the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints but when all is said and done no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie multi player unfortunately is not as thrilling goldeneye still has the best multi player mode of any bond game eon s main multi player is a co op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond s a more standard third person death match can be unlocked from this mode but the single player mode is the most complete bond experience to date the ending as with most bond games is anticlimactic while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing also levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error still for any serious bond fan not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films 
648,my eyes in the name of god and all that is holy make me unsee this movie what drugs are you people on this could very well be the worst movie ever i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time i need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster from start to finish glow ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema when i thought to watch this movie with my jewish best friend and his family we thought oh hey this may be funny it will probably be bad but still a little funny how wrong we were we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be all of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the film was over and during the course of the movie one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon i wish i had watched the video from the ring instead that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days for all who wish to see this movie you are not prepared you may think you are some sort of tough guy by renting this but this movie will break you push you to the ground and urinate on you 
891,myself and my groovadelic 20 something pals just can t get enough of this awesome parker posey classic i tried renting this on dvd but can t seem to find it too bad as i m sure the features would be extra special we all highly recommend this uber cool comedy flickerino for a date or even just a cozy night home alone this would also be the purr fect type of movie to watch with your cat or even throw a party based on like a party girl party just like the one in the movie that the lovable huggable squeezable parker posey goes to at the end oh and be on the lookout for a gripping and hilarious surprise ending move aside the sixth sense you ve just been outdone by a way radder movie sorry no offense just calling it like it is take it from an old flick lover comedy just doesn t get better than party girl with parker p feel it yours ronald marie macdougall aka dj cyber rap :)
725,great chris diamantopoulos has got to be the best robim williams that i have every seen he acts it up perfectly this was like watching robim williams as he really was and is it almost made me cry watching him i had no idea that robin was as close a friend to john belushi as he was the portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it s own merits very sad what both of them went through i really felt for both val and robin during his rough times i am glad that they ended it in a high note i hope robin puts a 100 bill in this guy s hat and it was great that it was filmed in vancouver 
787,i ve just finished viewing the 1st disc in a 4 disc 26 episodes collection created in conjunction with the ucla film television archive s more entertainment inc so far aside from the 1st episode the image quality is quite good the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdb mr peepers is just as charming as when i first saw it 5 years old at the time and wally cox is truly endearing in this role if you re in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head you ll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood although some of the gags are a bit corny most are ingenious and well executed and even the corny ones are fun this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it 
191,after watching this movie i couldn t help but notice the parallels between it and another film called america 3000 both were very bad mid 1980 s post apocalypse disasters on celluloid obviously fake sets wooden acting and stupid monsters are found in both films about the only difference between the two is that the lead villainess here played by angelika jager has a very thick accent avoid this one unless you re watching the mst3k version joel and the bots barely salvage this turkey 
520,some people say this show was good in it s early years i disagree with all of em the show is just plain stupid and pathetic my mum hates it i hate it my dad hates it i don t know about my sister but oh well here some reasons why 1 the characters babies being used as grown up style characters are stupid the babies are just precocious and annoying the grown ups and adults are dumb and unappealing the worst character is that angelica pickles she really does it in for your ear drums when you had a long hard and miserable day at the office and also that kimi finster who appears later on she is too over optimistic and a pain in the butt she can t decided whither she is french or japanese it doesn t matter know you are a american citizen know and that s that oh what am i talking about all the characters from this show suck 2 the stories the stories are unoriginal and dumb the make it like the babies go off on a great adventure yeah to the back yard shed in one episode that little goofy brat tommy pickles the leader broke in to a television s control room and literally almost destroyed it don t give kids any idea to smash up normal t v station s control rooms they pay a awful lot of money for them in real life i can imagine what the broadcasters must of felt like airing this episode they will probably start staring at their machines throughout the day scared that a baby will brake in sad 3 over rated the show has been dragging on for years now and people are still making up stories and new series and spin offs for this get off the simpsons have been going for nearly the same amount of time as this but they are much better and funnier than babies the show is just plain over rated people where is your common sense anyway i surprised t v stations across the world want to air this series even off today the show is utter junk and should have never been produced the two movies for this cartoons sucked just the same 2 10
365,hard to believe this was directed by fritz lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries this movie has a cast that includes robert young randolph scott dean jagger and john carradine scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving jagger s life jagger works for western union a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about indian attacks and bandits scott is in charge of the men and young is a telegraph expert who can t shoot a gun but can ride scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but scott can t tell anyone it s a pretty good western and lang should of directed some more westerns 
539,lindy meryl streep and her husband michael sam neill have just welcomed a baby girl azaria as seventh day adventists they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church with their two older boys looking on michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayer s rock one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia not being wealthy the family camps near the site after a wonderful first day lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents suddenly she hears azaria crying as lindy rushes to the tent a dingo dog is just exiting shaking his head the baby is gone and soon so is the dingo although the entire camp looks for the baby she is not found concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child the chamberlains struggle to accept god s decision and go on with their lives but unfortunately the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby she is subsequently arrested and put on trial how could this happen this is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination the entire country turns against the chamberlains in part because they are seen as odd streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy whose own strong willed demeanor works against her every step of the way neill likewise does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael the cast is one of the largest ever with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindy s case the costumes scenery script direction and production are all top of the line if you have never seen or heard of this film remedy that straight away it is not a far cry from reality to say that this cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media 
184,this sleek sexy movie is a must see only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film personally i enjoy the narrator for his intelligent no subject left untouched style of narration the introduction grips you right away and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film he provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really connect with internal horror this film exhibits the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully not only for kids but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography it surely defines the word masterpiece 
985,yesterday i finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie my knowledge of the plot was limited to about 60 seconds of the trailer but i had heard some good critics which caused my expectations to increase as i saw the movie those untied pieces had been combined in a story that was becoming quite intriguing with some apparently inexplicable details but in the end everything is disclosed as a simple succession of events of bad luck sorte nula in portuguese above everything i felt that the story made sense and everything fits in it s place properties of a good script i must also mention the soundtrack which helps the creation of an amazing environment and if you think of the resources fernando fragata used to make this film i believe it will make many hollywood producers envious 
694,i wouldn t call we re back a dinosaur s story simply a kiddie version of jurassic park i found it more interesting than that like the former it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices john goodman rhea perlman jay leno walter cronkite julia child kenneth mars yeardley smith martin short and larry king to paraphrase that a given actor the cheers woman the tonight show host the most trusted name in news a famous chef the young frankenstein police chief lisa simpson one of the three amigos and the cnn guy but i guess that i shouldn t focus only on the cast i thought that this movie had something for both children purely fun and adults natural history true it s escapism but the perceptive kind i would actually say that john goodman doing rex s voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in monsters inc worth seeing 
227,did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what sound effects background music and the editing in general was so bad you d think some 12 year old wanna be made the film most of the acting was good considering the script the innocent virgin played her part really well the mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel but unfortunately for all involved that s not the case turn left was made better than this movie and those guys didn t even have any money good thing i didn t rent the movie myself 
252,pushing daisies truly is a landmark in television as an art form everything seems to pay homage to amelie and tim burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not it is just brilliant i have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the shield and the wire ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of pushing daisies is that it has no comparisons on television truly addictive and an absolute pleasure perhaps like one of the piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways 
6,falsely accused skirt chasing chums john wayne as john scott and eddy chandler as kansas charlie change identities to become alias smith and jones mr wayne becomes john jones mr chandler s is supposed to be rev smith but wayne calls him dr smith at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis pete duel jonathan harris or ben murphy although wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them career wise pretty blonde mary kornman as anne grown up from her days in our gang is a lovely interest for wayne she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne if you re not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the 1930s this movie won t make you one 
278,where was his critique of democratic administrations as well as republican ones after all he did serve for 17 years in a body of government where his influence was unwaivering oh i forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most powerful nation on earth the film is happy to show shots of a young senator gore asking why a nasa scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper but fails to ask about the complicity of clinton gore in global warming probably too close to an election year or maybe it would hurt the chances for hillary in 08 either way he s a political coward and party man to the bitter end he offers no criticism of consumerism no criticism of capitalism no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time in the end this film was much more about mr gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces mr gore if you really wanted to make a campaign film shorten it call it what it really is 
757,some of the reviewers of this film were extremely generous with praise i personally was disappointed because due to those reviews i was optimistic as the opening credits began to roll the all too familiar story line goes like this deformed boy and his father live out in louisiana swamp local boys ridicule and torment him local boys start gruesome s oh sorry i mean victor crowley s cabin on fire with him in it dad attempts to rescue his son formerly known as eddie munster meets the elephant man but accidentally puts a hatchet through the kid s head instead victor becomes a murderous ghost who hunts down unfortunates who enter his domain oooo scary one thing i appreciated about hatchet was that it never took itself seriously and some of the gags even made me laugh the thing is i ve grown tired of the hollywood polished b horror slap sticks i like to laugh and i enjoy a good scare but this film didn t deliver a solid dose of either as for crowley being the next michael jason or freddy pumpkinhead has a better chance 
392,this has got to be the funniest movie i have seen in forever chritopher guest is truly talented he has a gift for humor i almost died laughing actually when i saw this in theaters i considered walking out because the movie was so dumb but it is dumb in a good way it is funny dumb and this is a really good combination you will be laughing from start to end this mockumentary style film follows an array of characters all competing at the kennel club dog show the cast includes parker posey fred willard eugene levy catherine o hara john michael higgens michael mckean larry miller bob balaban jennifer coolidge and tons more this is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing someone born without a personality would laugh at this film it is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity best in show 5 5 
795,soldier isn t a great movie and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons but i liked soldier alot partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised me first the art direction is tight and well executed as far as science fiction backdrops go soldier was doing things with more design then 90 the genre the sets costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed i didn t love all of their future military style but i was impressed with the effort for me this made the movie worth the time it took to watch second i m a kurt russell fan i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth the barefoot executive and his john carpenter films soldier is essentially an action movie and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero it s not an award winning role but kurt musters up convincing emotion with very little dialog third the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed this isn t iron monkey or even the matrix but once again it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre if you haven t seen it and you like sci fi action films pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice just don t expect the next bladerunner 
913,greetings from lithuania this is the first question that comes to head after watching this movie you know i saw a lot of bad movies in my life but after watching this one i only had two questions 1 is this was just a parody spoof 2 how could people create such a thing if you never saw this film than you really don t know what is a really bad film i mean bad the script are you kidding my acting is so horrible that i thing the actors where just having fun in this movie i know this is b movie but come on is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage oh and what an ending a must miss ending just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw wait until the ending because that kind of ending you have never saw before and i hope you will never see awoid this movie at any cost and don t say i didn t warn you 
563,what an atomic bomb of a movie the story goes nowhere and comes fron nowhere it leaves the theatre goer with ones arm up saying is this it what happened to redford he was once a fair actor now he thinks that he can show up on the set and make a few scenes and it s a take wrong what an unemotional film i don t mean to be so so cruel but what crap of a movie unbelievable amateur crap if i was in this movie i would be so embarased that i would not show my face i tell you what if i was associated with this movie i am in big trouble this movie will go down in the annals of movie making as the king of bombs with which all others will be compared to 
193,oh how awfully this movie is i don t know if it is a horror film or a drama cause the story and the both genres are not established very well the story is not moving it is slow boring and sleepy from the beginning to end this movie really bores me but i really liked the camera work it is authentic fresh and clear the acting is great too the little boy was the great performer in this movie but it hasn t made me to jump from my seat but this movie makes me grab a pillow lay on the bed and sleep until the credits roll boring not worth watching i tell you this movie sucked 1 10
444,i made it about 8 minutes into steel frontier before i turned it off then glutton for punishment that i am i watched some more the next day today i had to iron a pile of clothes so i decided to finish the movie and that was its own punishment here s what i don t understand robert rodriguez and shane carruth each spent 7 000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money and they churn out a huge steaming pile of crap let me see if i can figure out the logic it s road warrior but it s like a future western we ll get the cheapest actors we can find we ll have my mentally challenged cousin write the script and we ll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions we can t lose seriously i don t think even the mst3k guys could improve this but if you insist on watching it i recommend getting very drunk first 
370,beyond the clouds is a hauntingly beautiful elegiac work of art the overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in makes you want to touch the screen the autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience or to put it another way an old man i know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds nearly all the people in this film are beautiful unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo that is the dialogue doesn t really matter too much not that there is much of it anyway and as for storylines forget it some films exist just as visual experiences this is one of them don t bother if you want simple entertainment this not for you i could enthuse about the visual perfection of this movie for days but i won t if you are at all interested in cinematography photography film direction etc watch this film 
476,i saw this film at the boston internation festival of women s cinema last night and was saddened to hear ms troche tell us in her q a after the screening that she doesn t expect to see too much us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the so called gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed the full monty so it s really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose troche s direction make this one of the funniest films i ve seen 
420,this is a very beautiful and almost meditative film there is hardly any dialogue in it apart from the narration and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly i didn t at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend who also has red hair it is almost an old fashioned type of children s films saying that children nowadays prefer animations like shrek or toy story etc but i feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages not just children 
116,this is unfortunately carlin s last recorded hbo concert from a series that lasted over 30 years though this may not be his best work it is excellent funny and thought provoking this recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit lengthier than most of his other concerts throughout his long prolific and influential career carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes towards a more humanitarian viewpoint of society and culture his focus on the english language and euphemisms increased throughout the years and culminates in this performance though i would argue that his audio book when will jesus bring the pork chops best displays his vast wit with regards to language euphemisms and the breakdown of our values it s bad for ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer if you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church you will probably not like any of carlin s stand up material however if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy you would probably greatly enjoy this concert 
529,sistas in da hood looking for revenge and bling bling except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s i do not remember any westerns like this when i was growing up what would randolph scott say if he saw lil kim he might say alright i have to admit that i tuned into this just to see her bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick but these are the cowgirls and they are fine now don t go looking for any major story here and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting and when s the last time you heard john wayne call someone dawg and i don t remember the earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the ok corral i watch this on bet so i missed the action that got it an r rating but i doubt if i will buy the dvd to see it unless i can be assured it was lil kim in that action 
98,rumor has it that when the nasa technical advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable they laughed for several hours after all unless you are a politician or work crew the shuttle you are not going to get in the shuttle furthermore space cadet camp is in alabama not florida the truth is everyone on earth will win multi billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible this film was meant for kids and had to have been written by one because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to ksc ccafs this is the most useless film of all time and it was a well deserved flop 
963,this was like watching the trailer of a up and coming movie except that there was no movie coming up the film is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished as to be almost laughable the subject of this film is over a very short time frame and frankly nothing much actually happens in the 90 odd minutes of screen time i was hoping for the definitive australian film about our soldiers in wwii and how they fought against incredible odds in awful conditions this is most certainly not it having said that the acting was great and locations authentic this could easily have been a great movie given a lot more money and time instead it isn t even mediocre and i cannot recommend it at all 
657, dead letter office is a low budget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service struggling to rebuild their damaged lives unfortunately the acting is poor and the links between the characters past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over schematically represented what s most disappointing of all however is the portrayal is life in the office of the film s title there s no mechanisation whatsoever and it s quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living granted part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s if it ever truly existed it s a shame as the film s overall tone is poignant and wry and there s some promise in the scenario but few of the details convince overall it feels the work of someone who hasn t actually experienced much of real life a student film with a concept and an outline but sadly little else 
574,this movie is so bad i knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person very bad acting very bad plot very bad moviedo yourself a favour and don t watch it 1 10
376,it was once suggested by pauline kael never a fan that cassavetes thought not like a director but like an actor what kael meant was his supposed lack of sophistication as a filmmaker to take that comparison further to me it never feels like cassavetes is directing himself in a film it feels like cassavetes implanting himself inside his own creation like orson welles cassavetes is just as much of a genius as welles but far more important as a true artist as opposed to a technician or rhetorician this is like a cross between italian passion though cassavetes was actually greek and scandinavian introversion never before have inner demons been so exposed physically it s about the mystery of becoming performing and acting like a haunted skip james record it s got the echoes of ghosts all around rowlands breakdowns which are stupefying and almost operatic surprising coming from cassavetes are accompanied by a jumpy unsettling piano who is this dead girl the metaphysical possibilities are endless and it s amazing to find this kind of thing in a cassavetes film just the overt display of intelligence there is also a brief bit of voice over at the beginning but then he always was intelligent he just never flapped it around for easy praise this is not adaptation here the blending of reality and fiction and drama is not to show cleverness but to show the inner turmoil and confusion it creates there s so much going on the pure joyous love when rowlands greets her doorman the horror when she beats herself up the scene where the girl talks about how she devoted her life to art and to music is one of the most effective demonstrations of understanding what it means to be a fan of someone you can see some roots of this in a star is born and almodovar borrowed from it for all about my mother i think the ending is a little bit of a disappointment because of the laughing fits but the preparation leading up to it is almost sickening you can shoot me but i think the alcoholism despite its urgency in many of the scenes is a relatively small point about the film it s a living breathing thing and it feels like a process it could go any direction at any time like taste of cherry we are reminded that you must never forget this is only a play yet it is dangerous when rowlands says that line is it great drama how will the audience take it is she being reflexive or does she just not care her character s breakdowns are incorporated into the performances and ultimately the film in such a way that it s like witnessing a female james dean 10 10
485,i don t understand the exaggerated good critics about this film except that a lot of people from venezuela are understandably very excited based on that the venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind of what other countries are in the region the movie first of all is too repetitive a lot of scenes are almost identical from each of the both leading roles so you get the impression that it s a time filler a time filler is also a good point as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes you will start to get tired after a while and watch on the clock all actors are quite bad by exception of the venezuelan guy edgar ramirez who brings in a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the venezuelan recruit pedro by the way this is not a representative movie about the people of the region caribean zone it tends to ridicules them 
293,i saw bogard when it was released in the 70s it was one of those pictures that received an x rating for violence we snuck into our local grindhouse and saw it anyway pretty good picture lots of blood from the street fights although the cheap sound effects for the punches took something away from it and lots of sex i remember one of the early scenes when bogard meets this pretty brunette in an apartment she is showing him without saying a word he picks her up puts her in the windowsill and nails her from what i remember the picture sailed from that point on so when i found out bogart is also called black fist and was available on vhs i ordered it online i was very disappointed black fist is bogard edited for television so many of the scenes i remember were missing i wondered if indeed this was the same picture 
577,joe buck jon voight decides he s going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tutti fruttis wide eyed he comes to new york city not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other in the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffmann a homeless looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building there isn t much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe buck s plights in the city but also inter cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie jennifer salt who was gang raped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery everybody s talking we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city the odds are high he won t and will end up working for pennies in a dead end job shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this a dark story of dashed hopes john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s and at the center the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers ratso s reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed older wiser 
179,a hard to find film which coasts on the still pervasive mythology of senator joe mccarthy as a political demon king boyle as joe gives a compelling but historically inaccurate portrayal of the wisconsin senator the caricature mccarthy many take as the real one meredith as wily army lawyer joseph welch who outsmarted mccarthy at the army hearings in 1954 is very good as always in fact mccarthy and cohn were quite right in worrying about the appalling security situation in the army and the 1954 army hearings became enmeshed in the smokescreen used by the army to deflect the investigation away from their security failings which the committee were investigating by counter charging that mccarthy and cohn were trying to get favours for their staffer david schine whilst in the service the film is self satisfied agenda driven polemic based in the pervasive myths which have passed for the truth with many people for decades that the red scare was essentially phony and mccarthy huac etc were always blasting away at the wrong targets being no more than lying career ruining publicity hounds who were trampling over the constitutional rights of startled innocent liberals who were accused of being security risks communists people who know little about the matter still feel confident in repeating misinformation on mccarthy and the red scare to this day clooney s murrow hagiography is an example the misinformation is pervasive no wonder people have swallowed it a recent obit of budd schulberg in the serious left wing uk newspaper the guardian headlined that the hollywood writer named names to mccarthy perpetuating the lie that mccarthy investigated hollywood as head of huac the truth being that mccarthy was never even a member of huac and he had little interest in the politics of hollywood types his investigations were confined almost exclusively to arms of the us government the mythology about the red scare being baseless is now completely exploded by recently opened soviet and us government documents if anything mccarthy and co underestimated the sheer scale of soviet and fellow traveller infiltration in the us but decades of public misinformation about this period will be hard to correct one day maybe some really brave hollywood soul will make a movie telling the truth about how many american men and women clandestinely aided the mass murderer stalin and worked to impose his vicious system of government on the western world giving an accurate account maybe of joe mccarthy s career but i won t hold my breath till then we have this mythical drunken lying scoundrel of popular imagination so familiar in the media tail gunner joe 
651,i only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie no it was a hundred times worse ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that s not true the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever the american cop has a german accent the police station was a desk in a warehouse with a sign police station hanging on the wall there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet this cop pulls women over cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse he tells his cop partner to wait in the car then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women but he isn t sure if that is what s happening because he s a moron the dialog is totally stupid the acting is awful and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen it is totally obvious to the cop s partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it and yet the partner who is there all along doesn t know what is happening the director of this film is a total hack i stopped the movie at 30 minutes because i couldn t take it anymore it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won t waste anymore time on it writing this review absolutely worthless 
867,wow i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent cliché about the police this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time a perfect tradeoff 
953,this film moves the cinderella story forward to the early 1950s and makes good if eccentric use of the isle of man as a background the ugly sisters have become wildly glamorous upper class english girls and together with kathleen turner as the stepmother they flounce about in various wonderful period costumes the story is altered a little from the traditional version early on it is oddly combined with the plot of king lear and in later stages cinderella is rather more assertive than is usual it looks splendid and works on the whole pretty well but does go over the top at times 
560,everyone is a genius in something albert einstien was a genius in science william shakespeare was a genius in literature and the boys from the chasers war on everything are truly comedy geniuses their satire tv show is a constant hit on the australian broadcast commission abc after a small start as a satire newspaper the chasers popularity skyrocketed when given their own television show never short on controversy with the cast members will do everything some of it even being arrested for chris taylor going on sunrise a very popular live morning television show and telling his partner to f k off creating a fake motorcade and driving into apec high security area and doing a very funny satire of a australian ad about nicotine by following smokers around yelling out no gary no no gary no while controversial the show is increably funny and worthy of running for years to come 
432,true the idea for this tv series may have sprung from the immense success which ally mcbeal is enjoying worldwide even here in germany however this said edel starck is very different from ally mcbeal in many ways the two main characters work beautifully together felix edel felix noble played by well known german actor christoph m ohrt and sandra starck sandra strong noble strong get it played by charming rebecca immanuel exchange quick romantic repartees and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom like criminal cases in berlin and surroundings further they are aided by a magnificent cast of co stars most notably their secretary played by isabel tuengerthal who is a rare gem with great comic potential also the shady wheeler dealer otto and the noble childhood pal of felix frank work very well not to forget sandra s best friend and room mate patricia played by the beautiful barbara demmer all in all a joy to watch on monday nites no wonder that the series and its stars have received several prizes will felix get sandra i hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out 
328,drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending basically a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high pitched sound wave being emitted by some military equipment some favorite parts of mine from this episode are mulder s dialogue in the car and the scene where scully goes in with the hazmat team and find the little old deaf lady completely unaffected by what they thought was a virus the ending of course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that they are going to actually be able to pull off this elaborate plan to save the victim but when mulder arrives the man is already dead 8 10
194,anyone who has seen the piece of steaming smelly poo called congo understands my title and i feel for you this movie wasn t just bad it was painful the book was stupid the script was even dumber and the cast was terrible dylan walsh rumor has it julia roberts dumped your ass cause this movie blew so bad huge diamonds killer gorillas talking gorillas hmmm sounds like a hit oh tim curry s accent is so bad in this movie i would prefer being deaf i recommend this movie to bulimics looking to purge after a heavy meal or kavorkian patients who just need that one more reason to die if this is faithful to the book i would say lets have us a good old fashion footloose book burning and destroy every copy if future generations look back and find this garbage how would we explain ourselves listen to the others who hated this movie don t watch it run away do not watch this movie if you think it is full of action or suspense or cool effects you are wrong if you think it blows more cock than nicole ritchie you d be right so if you still are going to watch crapo i mean congo i say do it after you just took 50 tylenol pm 
684,this solid little horror film is actually one of renny harlin s best the story is pretty routine stuff but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive in fact the ghost story is almost an afterthought the real horror comes from the prison setting itself and renny h spares no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling leaking rat infested old hellhole with a sadistic warden too viggo mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role supported by some very authentic looking prisoners there are no pretty boys in this cast horror fans should check this one out 
637,great premise poor execution cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written poorly directed poorly edited waste of film only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food joan chen mercedes ruehl kyra sedgwick and alfre woodard should fire their agents 
231,ocean s 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on like a celebrity awards presentation each major actor actress is introduced in short 60 second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking applaud now sign the first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed poorly edited and at times utterly unrelated to the story and confusing speaking of the story there is one kinda but its barely visible for all the look at me shots and cameos only matt damon seemed to actually act during this film the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat pack wanna be session as for the heist the action the drama it was put into the last 8 10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic horrible horrible horrible 
547,i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn t make it to the end credits first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting lame sfx and extremely poor direction pales in comparison to the original anyone ever hear about the old et atari 2600 fiasco for those who haven t let me fill you in it s 1982 et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time atari decides to release a movie tie in game on their 2600 home console system to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari 2600 et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn t even give them away let alone sell them what does universal soldier the return have to do with this story look at the 3 2 rating and figure it out for yourself awful film imdb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems doesn t go as low as 0 let alone into the negatives 
714,fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid this short parody is at least as much a part of the star wars saga as phantom menace and far more entertaining if you ask me hardware wars was the first in a long line of sw spoofs which form their own subgenre these days i hate to describe it too much it s so short that the premise is just about the whole thing suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of star wars have fun poked at them household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spaceships and robots the princess anne droid character wears actual bread rolls on her head instead of the famous coils of braided hair and fluke starbucker is even more of a dork than his original if that s possible ernie fosselius is one crazy son of a buck he s also the source of porklips now the apocalypse now spoof 
145,despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes this entry the fourth feels tired toshiharu ikeda who directed the superb mermaid legend and the seminal japanese splatter film evil dead trap shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise a miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot predictable stalking harassing assault and rape ensues the staple of roman porno is sex and sex mixed with violence both potentially exciting subjects to be sure but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh a masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening via condom is too little kink to late the series rain motif continues and the film s final scene brings relief 
31,for what it is this is a pretty good movie i like both johns stamos full house stockwell christine top gun they both give strong performances the love interest is ok but this is more of a guy s movie than a good date movie i love harleys and i hated seeing them paint over the 14 coats of hand rubbed lacquer with good old army olive drab there is a small history lesson here in that harley davidson motorcycles played a key role in wwii i don t know if the training was quite like this bunches the movie kept my interest all the way through without getting slow anywhere with good riding action sequences i love looking at the demographics of the vote history one 18 year old man gave the movie a 10 true bike lover i guess i wouldn t give it a 10 but i did give it an 8 i do not weigh every movie with the same scale there are movies that were big budget with great actors that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big star wars episode i is my best example i loved the first three sw movies but i thought episode i was weak in comparison so it gets a lower rating from me than this movie i expect more from george lucas 
556,you can take the crook out of the joint but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook we ve seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before and since in movies like bob le flambeur elevator to the gallows touchez pas au grisbi the anderson tapes etc too many times to mention what helps make this one one of the more notable is of course the heist itself which plays out wordlessly in real time and the demeanor of the lead bogart would think twice before crossing this guy the ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story it almost demands it all around one of the better films noir 
216,as a gamer i can t say i like this film fact is i down right hate it i tried to watch it as open minded as possible but when it gets down to it it feels rather insulting to my social group to me there are several reasons why 1 the characters seem unnatural i ve met lots of players of all different walks of life i don t know any who act like any of the characters in the film it s like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people most gamers are rather social people some with rather active lives 2 the style doesn t work the mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film an actual documentary on gamers would actually work better while it is good looking i e cleanly put together it isn t very good 3 the dialogue feels forced unnatural it also seems to lack any real world context gamers swear i ll admit that but we don t have tourette s syndrome 4 the humor is lacking while self deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups i ve encountered this is less self deprecation and more like toilet humor likewise a large part of gamer humor is full of in jokes and anecdotes not toilet humor most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes 5 the biggest problem to me is basically this accuracy i don t mean rules but instead dynamics invariably this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the gamers and the gamers dorkness rising both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game the difference is gamers the movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs the gamers where you can say something like huh i know a guy like that yep that s definitely like gary 
887,you should never ever even consider to watch this movie it is absolutely awful this isn t an overstatement it is so unbelievable and exaggerated it gets boring it is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one they writer hasn t been able to pull it off in a good way if you d like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you but still you should plug your ears and just watch it s not worth listening p there are so many great movies out there and if i could choose one this would be the last movie i would pick but all in all it s your choice enjoy 
635, hardbodies 2 is harmless aimless and plot less i would add brainless to that list but the movie within a movie gimmick although not done very well helps it to narrowly escape that label the scenery has changed from the california beaches to the greek islands and the only returning cast members from the first film are sorrells pickard the bearded guy and roberta collins who at one point falls into a mud pit bringing back memories of her classic catfight with pam grier in the big doll house all the other actors are new but apparently brad zutaut is supposed to be playing the same character scotty as grant cramer did in hardbodies this sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie and doesn t come close to matching it in the hotness department either of course brenda bakke and fabiana udenio are both very pretty but the teal roberts cindy silver kristi somers team is unbeatable hardbodies 2 is not the worst of its kind by any means but if you only want to see one of these movies the original is the one to get 1 2 
487,this movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies i have seen the acting was utterly superb and when i wasn t drying my tears i enjoyed meryl streep who s performance was extraordinary the movie deals with the hardships of a distant family coping with a mother who develops terminal cancer the movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking the soundtrack fits this movie to a tee brava bette midler out of 5 stars i give this one 4 1 2 
388,when i read the synopsis for messiah in the television guide i was not prepared for what was in store the story follows dci metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across london he soon realises a pattern there is a serial killer on the loose killing people with similar names and jobs to those of the 12 apostles and their killings are identical to their matching apostle the two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat with metcalfe closely pursuing the killer but always missing him within a couple of seconds and discovering the gruesome mess he has left behind of his ill fated victim messiah is sure to cause a great deal of controversy but nonetheless it is the greatest piece of drama the bbc has shown in a long time 
525,i really liked this movie but the ads i saw implied and one published review actually said that this movie benefits from a light touch that to me is very misleading there is indeed plenty of humor eccentric un subtle sometimes somewhat twisted humor the kind of humor i generally find very appealing indeed but most of the humor is the kind that appears conscious at all times of things deeply serious deeply sensitive even deeply painful the movie weaves together themes of past and present perception and truth memory and activity life and death the entire movie is suffused by the history of european anti semiticism in general and of the holocaust in particular how can humor and horror be combined in the same movie the review i saw suggested that the humor is absurdist i don t think this is the case at all at least not in the common sense instead i think this movie stands in the tradition of much jewish yiddish literature and theatre i don t claim to be any kind of expert in this area but from what i ve seen humor is used in this cultural context both as a coping tool for the horribly tragic experiences of this people and also humor is used as a means of recovering the divine for men and women who choose a path of faith rather than a path of either despair or absurdism see fiddler on the roof for humor used in both ways in this rich tradition elijah wood jonathon wood wears horn rimmed glasses that really make him look well strange compare sin city when he wore the same kinds of glasses with chilling effect in this movie it s easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his search and for his struggle between perception and truth eugene hutz young alex and boris lesking old alex are both really just wonderful jonathon and young alex are from the same generation yet seem so very very different and then find that they are not so different after all and the way in which the apparent narrative voice changes gradually from that of jonathon to that of young alex as a journey of intended discovery for jonathon becomes one of discovery for both young alex and old alex is to me so very moving there are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from i m told prague and environs standing in for the ukraine of the story line all feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place although i ve never been myself to the ukraine and can hardly testify to this from first hand experience all in all if you re looking for light comedy i would not recommend this movie at all on the other hand if you are interested in a wonderful delightful and deeply moving film please check out this wonderful movie 
583,i m not saying that just as a chris rock fan i m saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong the first flaw was it s everything works out ending that everybody saw coming flaw number two was i found that the chemistry between regina king and chris rock seemed fake finally the acting in this movie was sub par with the best actor being regina king and the worst being mark addy but i saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy in a heads up scenario watch heaven can wait instead it s better so for all you chris rock fans out there watch this movie you ll enjoy out he has some good stand up in this movie overall 7 out of 10
582,this movie had potential the script was not bad and it presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide patricide regrets and as chris says 10 years of going nowhere it s a sharp contrast to the original mag7 which was bright humorous and even the bad guy was lovable it s a very interesting change of tone and if they had developed the characters more maybe i would ve liked it but instead they waste far too much time on gratuitous and ridiculous battle scenes poorly edited together at one point you see a horse fall and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again but not many people would notice that since there are already 2 dozen horse trips i m not exaggerating and by then we ve already dozed off which leads me to the title of my review this film was extensively cut due to animal cruelty so chances are if you decide to watch it you ll get the watered down kiddie version there s a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull and suddenly as the crowd erupts cheering there s no bull just the matador in an empty arena like wow maybe the bull was a jedi i dunno more likely the scene was cut later there s a cockfight scene where in the original version one of the birds gets horribly mauled before a crowd of cheering mexicans this was cut but we still see enough to get pretty annoyed but by far the worst scenes are the horse throws one after the other you see horses legs get yanked sending thousands of pounds of horse onto its head in one scene a horse gets thrown and then while it s squirming on the ground in paralytic convulsions an explosive goes off right under its neck this film was made in 1966 when hollywood was just starting to regulate animal brutality on film this is probably one of the last flicks where you can see it happen so if that sort of stuff it floats yer boat check it out you ll get a mild thrill but if not you ll either be irritated or flat out bored 
462,this film was both entertaining and thought provoking i d recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged great acting directing and it is canadian to boot it is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers the locations in ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era with so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick for any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle be it financial or illness this film strikes a resounding chord it approaches the idea of the afterlife in a contemporary way without cheaply capitalizing on all the gohst and supernatural themes that have become staples in hollywood and the tv networks 
149,i really liked this film all three stars connery fishburne and underwood give credible performances and harris is enjoyably over the top the lighting and shot angles in some of harris scenes make his face look truly diabolical the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting not a great movie but an enjoyable one i gave it 7 of 10 
333,i ve seen this film at least 4 times since 84 and it s still great every time i see it it s a very compelling version of the opera carmen with amazing flamenco dancing bare bones sets and of course wonderful music this telling of carmen is a story within a story with each paralleling the other until the doubly tragic ending obviously a low budget spanish production the film contains dancing by some of spain s premier flamenco dancers the combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage makes the telling of the story even more powerful it s independent movie making at it s best and probably my all time favorite foreign film 
717,i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i ve seen in years unlike the recent trend of 90 s horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self mocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here this is the perfect blend of 80 s and 90 s horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90 s films and the stalking slasher madness of an 80 s flick i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right direction denise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie 
421,this is undeniably the scariest game i ve ever played it s not the average shoot everything that moves kind of fps which i usually don t care much for but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects scryeeee scryeeee and above all incredible atmosphere i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game i ve had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere i m a great horror fan escpecially of clive barker s stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story 9 10 1 because i m no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short 
164,i once promised never to walk out of any film a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck such as rambo 3 baise moi deep impact but mr seidl almost succeeded hundstage was a truly awful experience anyone who sees this movie will think that austrians are a miserable pathetic bunch of retards it shows a world where love and humanity don t exist a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason to distract from their own miserable existence by choosing a documentary like style with non professional actors most of them look like straight from the imagination of austrian shock cartoonist deix director seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in austrian european western suburbs the viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies violence against women and handicapped people madness and degradation but this isn t social criticism this is just pure shock without any aesthetic value instead you get bad acting bad cinematography bad filmmaking if anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes this is pseudo social criticism with a sledge hammer and it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way it shows ugly people that is not the reason why i hate it but it depicts average people in an ugly misanthropic way and this is why this film is truly despicable 
21,in 1979 i was a boy of 12 years old my parents had just got the home box office which was pretty new to our neighborhood as a 12 year old boy this was the first time i saw boobs on television i will never forget the joy of those times racing vans the total ass wipe with the baddest van the water bed the smoking of herbs the hot 70 s chicks the makin love in my chevy van song it was all so new to me a complete movie with all of the memories you could hope for i own it and enjoy it about once a year when i watch this movie it makes me want to get my skates with 4 wheels not in a strait line go to the park and hunt down some babes with feathered hair truly great memories of young adolescence 
183,movie about two australian girls debbie nell schofield and sue sue knight and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys i caught this at an art cinema here in america in 1981 technically i was still a teenager i was 19 so i was interested in seeing how australian teens acted script wise there s nothing new here it shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating sex suicide etc etc i always knew what was going to happen before it did but i was never bored what i found interesting was despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair these teenagers aren t much different than american teens they had many of the same difficulties and hang ups also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and i heard it was a faithful adaptation of it the acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and this was well made and pretty interesting so this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it s like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids i give it a 7 
837,brad pitt sticks his index finger in diane kruger s leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants funny horribly so the invented yarn takes the dirty dozen for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies lots of fun even paris when it sizzles is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog i was thrilled by christoph waltzer s character and by his sensational performance brad pitt creates a true original i love the actor s lack of vanity there s a quirk in the character that is pure brad pitt tarantino visits a new universe but fortunately his hand his brain and his heart are visible all over the place 
857,first off i m a huge fan of 80s movies and of jennifer conelly as well so yesterday i wandered into a local used book movie store and found a vhs copy i read the back and it sounded good and for 3 99 it was a good deal so i took it home and popped it in the vcr what a sweet movie at my age now i relate more to movies like about last night or st elmo s fire but still i remember what it was like to be 15 16 and in love with an older guy etc we all have those little crushes when we re younger and if it doesn t work out we re heartbroken and we think that we ll never get over it but of course we do many times it s that sort of sweet quality that i really got from this movie the feeling of oooh i remember when something like that happened to me is all through it the characters are interesting and well developed i recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies teen films in particular or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives 
3,this movie is likely the worst movie i ve ever seen in my life surpassing the previous most god awful movie spawn of slithis which i saw when i was about 10 bad acting stilted and ridiculous dialog incomprehensible plot mishmashed cut scenes even the music was annoying did i leave anything out well the special effects weren t bad but cgi does not a decent movie make i can t believe i actually spent money to see this movie if anyone has the contact info for hyung rae shim the director please forward it to my user name at gmail and i ll contact him to personally demand a refund 
622,if you watched the series and love the league as i do then prepare to be disappointed i went to the cinema with a group of die hard league fans and we were all in agreement that this film wasn t as funny or dark as the three series before in my personal opinion it was a money spinner the writing was contrived and the plot confused no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do it was self indulgence of the worst kind from writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticisms i hope the league at least can be honest enough with themselves and acknowledge this film as being inferior to the superb three series i will not be buying it despite owning most of the league memorabilia 
823,contains spoiler the movie is a good action comedy but i don t know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast the end of the movie come the bad guy dies and that s it the special effects are good and i don t regret paying to see it at the theatre 
414,how could this get a 6 0 rating are we as horror fans so used to horror films being so utterly bad these days that when one comes along that has some and i repeat only some redeeming quality s we get much too excited and give a rating that is just a wee bit too high the director has a certain visual flair no doubt about that but in between some decent shots he forgot a good story mood or scares it had a very slow first act lazy killing scene s annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist and what s with the portrayal of american teenagers in so many of these kinds of films do they always have to be this stupid irritating and so godd mn superficial i don t remember teens being like this when i grew up here in holland all things considered in can t give this film anything more that a 4 out of 10 rating 
393,my god buttgereit s masterpiece is one of the best movies i ve ever seen closer to peter greenaway and jean luc godard s movies this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive in spite of the lack of money see the bridge sketch highly highly recommended 
771,not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted i will only say this nearly everybody says they loved curly best but i will put brideless groom up against any of other the stooges shorts i think it s the most hilarious from start to finish as well as being the most re watchable the off key singing student christine mcintire s cousin basil routine and of course emil sitka s j p are highlights but only around the stooges impeccable timing and the great writing too nuff said 
497,the railway children at least this 1970 movie version written and directed by that long time british character actor lionel jeffries is an unmitigated classic it tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm the sentimentality is muted the evocation of childhood adventures is involving and jeffries brings cleverness and style to his production the waterbury family is leading an idyllic life in edwardian london the father is prosperous the mother is beautiful and loving the children are well mannered and affectionate their home is warm and cozy then one night during the christmas holidays two men appear at the doorstep talk quietly to the father and then take him away in a moment the lives of mrs waterbury dinah sheridan and bobbie 14 jenny agutter phyllis 12 sally thomsett and young peter gary warren have been changed only their fortitude and good spirits are going to see them through now teetering into poverty mrs waterbury takes her children to live in a musty old brick house in the countryside near a rail line not too far from a small village with a train station the children discover the rail and regularly sit on a small hill to wave at the passengers as the train chugs by one day an old gentleman going to his business in the city looks up from his newspaper and finds himself waving back it s not long before he will play an important part in the story as time passes mrs waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to bear on her children she begins to write stories to earn money she teaches them their lessons and provides a home of warmth and security for them the story however is about these three children especially bobbie at 14 she is old enough to want to share her mother s worries yet young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother they find a poor man at the station who cannot speak english they discover he is a russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are they insist he must come home with them and their mother takes him in before long the children have written a large sign to the old gentlemen on the train asking for his help they help a young man taking part in a steeplechase who breaks his leg in a train tunnel soon he is at their home recuperating they decide to have a birthday party for the station master a man with few friends and several children who is a stickler for his dignity it s not long before the children help him realize the difference between friendship and charity in other words the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures and manage to be instrumental in seeing that all the problems have happy endings but what of their own problems bobbie finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away because he had been accused of treason of giving state secrets to the russians will bobbie be able to find a way to help will the old gentleman be something more than simply an old gentleman on a passing train will their father s case be reopened will there be a happy ending jenny agutter was almost 18 when she filmed her part she plays the 14 year old bobbie with great naturalness and charm as important as the other players are especially dinah sheridan as the mother agutter is the heart of the story for me it is jenny agutter s talent and lionel jeffries style and restraint that make this movie so memorable the story s problems come with no serious doubt but that they will be solved and jeffries does not just give us an expertly adapted and directed movie he adds touches that are barely noticed but which charm us this might include just a split second of a freeze frame as two people talk or a slow close up of a small yellow wildflower in the grass outside bobbie s home then a slow pull back from a yellow oil lamp being turned up inside or the realization that a delightful interior shot or a view of the green countryside or a look at the train station from a hill all suddenly recall those charming edwardian hand tinted drawings of a perfect by gone time perhaps this gentle story can t compete for the time kids need nowadays to perfect their nintendo monster splatting skills i m almost positive it would never capture the attention of most of their parents especially those weaned on batman and leone still it s a perfectly put together movie and shouldn t be forgotten as an aside 19 years later the story was retold as a television program this time jenny agutter played the mother 
578,first of all i reviewed this documentary because i had an interest in the subject it portrayed the la punks i listened that music and i loved that music and i read a lot of the small zines that were made in the early 80 s and that were not so easily achieved in finland so if you don t like this kind of music why you write here about it i like this kind of music it speaks my soul thus i know punks from all over europe americas so why do you who find this music repugnant care to comment at all 
704,how living the dream managed to get into the laemmle 5 in west hollywood is beyond me as it is the worst film i have ever seen in my life i should have known when the first scene opened in gasp eugene oregon that this dud of a film with characters that you want to like and feel sorry for from their exclusion days from high school but can t as they are such losers is so wooden and atrocious with dialog that is beyond bad then cliché the three high school losers end up in la and here is where the film could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting but no one works as a used car salesman the other is a true loser in a garage call center selling magazines even the bastard that runs the place has more audience appeal than that dreadful actor with the horrible foreign accent and they fraudulently get money from an insurance scam to set up an executive recruitment firm with no experience just showing the supposed good life in la night spots with a cast of actors that are so wooden and bad they better not have sag cards i could go on and on about this bad film but i ended up walking out of the theater which had at the start six people and when i left four men were the only ones in the audience i wanted to like this film but i couldn t find one merit in the story characters writing dialog nor the actors whoever cast this film should retire amen enough 
482,there is only one racist joke in this daffy duck short which is basically when daffy rides black beauty it is a black woman i can understand partly why this joke was included as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn t even illegal to discriminate black people yet aside from this point a coy decoy is basically a fun interesting short where daffy meets characters in books and does things in books i liked this short quite a lot despite the other reviewers on here the way daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing yet highly amusing at the same time porky is a nice edition to the episode though it was not vital for him to be there the wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well blood thirsty terrible animals which of course they never really have been unless they are very hungry i also liked the style of animation used and the theme of the episode for people who are totally into daffy duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons enjoy a coy decoy available on youtube 
127,by 1945 and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces errol flynn s hold over u s box office had started to decline so in spite of the increased burden of waning looks he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler the first of these was a good one actually adventures of don juan 1948 but it also proved to be his last big budget hollywood starring vehicle the rest of his sword wielding days were spent wandering all over europe in england for kim 1950 the master of ballantrae 1953 and the dark avenger 1955 in france for adventures of captain fabian 1951 and italy for the aborted the story of william tell 1953 and the little seen crossed swords 1954 however hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways albeit for a modestly budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers a production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak still the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self his red headed leading lady maureen o hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger than life starring vehicles so here he is typically seen as the baddie the pirate captain roc brasiliano a role he attacks with gusto like the black shield of falworth 1954 a viewing of which preceded this one against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channels for all i know this might well have been the very first pirate movie i ve ever seen and i cringe at the thought of today s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about as i said earlier against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same nowadays the amorous persistence of the child like indian princess alice kelley towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk 1940 and the black swan 1942 to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars is briskly paced and reasonably engaging incidentally the film would later go on to be remade as the king s pirate 1967 with doug mcclure for what it s worth the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and as a matter of fact against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorly thought out pirates of the golden age movie collection set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneer s girl 1950 with yvonne de carlo doule crossbones 1951 with donald o connor and yankee buccaneer 1952 with jeff chandler value for money perhaps but so far i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources even so if the mood strikes me in future i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytyk s mutiny 1952 the afore mentioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga 1961 
500,if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot or corny acting then backdraft is definitely the one however if like me you like watching films that you can believe then backdraft has some serious flaws it doesn t offer anything new and there are hundreds of 90 s action films that follow identical formulas whilst not being quite as clunky after two firefights i m thinking this has got to go somewhere else i mean how many big fires are there in one city surely firemen do other things such as getting cats out of trees well i was wrong and the repetition continues again and again up until the end a good aspect of the film is the fire itself well filmed and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste 
613,i think this movie has got it all it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head it has cool looking characters is really funny you know the kind that you ll crack up on the ground and you ll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks despite the bad acting bad cgi and bad story about cops going after a robot its really cool its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch get together eat pizza laugh like crazy and watch it two more times there are so many funny parts like when kurt was trying to get edison s attention and gave him the finger and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball on that part i kept saying remember remember to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened there was also a really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was there just before they fought and kurt was talking about his strange dream and how he was superman i loved that part although it has been a while since i saw it so i don t remember that part everything the actors said were funny like how kurt says i worship you like a god to the robot although there was some bad things in all it was a great movie man i can t stop laughing i wish i had that movie 
870,this movie is somehow showing 6 2 stars it seems inconceivable that the director has that many relations i am at a loss to explain this avoid this movie at all costs you have only a certain number of hours on the earth don t waste 1 1 2 of them on this retarded steaming heap of guano there is no story as apparently the director wrote and i m guessing with a blunt orange crayon the next day s script at the completion of the day s shooting the story has been called whimsical no it is aimless there is maybe enough story to fill a commercial don t you hate ads now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here and similarly the writer director can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work toy love so to recap even if you get this movie for free even if you re paid to watch it avoid it to paraphrase monty python s search for the holy grail run flee 
658,this movie was flippin awful i wanted those hours of my life back for god s sake stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs its not worth mentioning the title but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this and where do i begin the dumb a kids in the movie the zero plot or story the garden variety college frat boy esquire scenes of towel slapping or the very bad acted teen angst innuendo my god it never ended i remember thinking i would have rather kissed the movie theater floor then sit through this one again but what do you expect most people with the brain power to look up reviews are not going to be the target audience here at all so go see pirites 2 again or the jet lee one if your debating to yourself look this movie will just cost you your soul your money your energy and your brain cells heed the warning 
765,like all of the very earliest films this movie is very very short lasting about one minute so because of its brevity it s not really possible to compare it to more modern films but for its time it s actually a very remarkable film much of this is because the prints were hand painted making annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance i ve actually seen two different versions one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout i think the red one depicted on the dvd the great train robbery and other primary works is the best of them the dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance art and unlike other one minute or less films of the day this one is one i could see repeatedly it s just that visually compelling and odd if you want to see it online there is a 36 second version on google video type in serpentine dance 
880,john van druten s bell book and candle is a delightful and unexpected fantasy about a coven of modern day witches living in new york city it was obviously an attractive movie property it had a stellar part for gillian holroyd for her erstwhile book publisher enforced sweetheart shepherd henderson and her madcap family and circle including shep s bewildered fiancée the hateful merle kittredge against whose chances with shep gillian begins her magical spell casting it even had pyewacket a siamese cat familiar with well timed miaows sidney redlitch a fake witch expert with atrocious pretensions and bad manners in short it seemed to its producer perhaps box office magic and so it proved to be so many things were right about its production it only had one element not perfect but i found the rest to be amusing charming and very consistently entertaining to begin with the screenplay by daniel taradash kept the best qualities of the fine theatrical play but opened out its scenes to include greenwich village and other areas of new york s scene the technical production was beautiful with cinematography by the legendary james wong howe a fine score by george duning more than clever sets by louis diage and gowns by jean louis in the attractive cast were wolfe barzell howard mcnear janice rule as merle ernie kovacs as redlitch jack lemmon as gillia s mischievous brother wonderful comediennes elsa lanchester and hermione gingold as fellow witches and lovely kim novak in one of her most touching parts as gillian jimmy stewart was the imperfect element in my judgment he did well with the comedic portions of his part but he was never convincing as a new york book publisher and a bit too old for the part of henderson anyhow but director richard quine used subtle lighting pace changes and unusually composed shots to indicate the oddness of the witch portions of the film keeping the other portions very luminous but straightforward in their presentation the plot s main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality gillian falls for henderson who does not believe in witches at all she started out merely to alienate him from his fiancée her stuck up college rival later when henderson tries to walk out he keeps coming back to her and realizes he is under a spell as she has apologetically tried to explain to him meanwhile sidney redlich has been summoned by witching spell to come to new york to sell his book to henderson of course he knows nothing at all of magic but is quite puzzled and interested to find out why he had come anywhere at all but gillian s brother enlightens him all comes out right in the end in this romantic satire as gillian proves her love to henderson by losing her powers which is what happens to witches when they truly love a mortal of course he never really wanted to resist her anyhow the film has sprightly dialogue charm and a little magic of its own in the fey charm of the witches and the torments gillian must undergo in her battle with herself and to win the man she loves a lovely ending to this beautifully photographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism though a fantasy just about complete in my view memorably delightful 
814,laurence olivier merle oberon ralph richardson and binnie barnes star in the divorce of lady x a 1938 comedy based on a play olivier plays a young barrister everard logan who allows oberon to spend the night in his hotel room when the london fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home the next day a friend of his lord mere richardson announces that his wife barnes spent the night with another man at the same hotel and he wants to divorce her believing the woman to be oberon olivier panics oberon who is single and the granddaughter of a judge pretends that she s the lady in question lady mere when she s really leslie steele we ve seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time with this cast it s delightful i mean richardson and olivier olivier and oberon that great team in wuthering heights pretty special olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight nervous barrister oberon gives her role the right light touch she looks extremely young here fuller in the face with jean harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her she wears some beautiful street clothes though her first gown looks like a birthday cake and in one gown she tries on with that hair do she s ready to play snow white binnie barnes is delightful as the real lady mere the color in this is a mess and as others have mentioned it could really use a restoration definitely worth seeing 
925,a precursor to citizen kane in its analysis of the life of a just deceased tycoon here reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks in spencer tracy s 15th film he already looks middle aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be young a little silent screen type emoting is understandable given the vintage but this is a most enjoyable well written drama 
603,i thought this movie was awesome and the two guys nick and aaron are hotties i wish i could watch it over and over i loved the plot and whole concept of the movie it is great and i wish i had taped it last night nick i love you 
986,i had no idea who bruce haack was before seeing this film i had just seen the moog doc which was alright the only problem was moog led a very content life and the doc was well content haack s story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days but it carries a great deal of heart with it though the film doesn t go into the tragic stuff so much one can sense that bruce accepted the price of making music his way there are so many elements that make up his legacy ie invention of the peopleodian where bruce could actually play music by touching people it must have been challenging to document haack s scatter brained output which pretty much fell into every musical category imaginable even rap music but the director cut the piece together very coherently and managed to capture the spirit and the cast what a group of characters bruce surrounded himself with but what do you expect from a telepathic guru tripping with kids fighting against the music industry i recommend this film to anyone interested in music history it s that mainstream but that important 
302,i don t pretend to be a huge asterix fan having only seen one other movie adaption and read only two of the comics but this was a superb movie all the same i only saw the english version and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters brad garret as obelix and sean astin as justforkix especially the story itself was both interesting and truly funny especially the contradicting name endings all the viking names end in af while all the gaulish names of course end in ix with a little romance thrown in that i though enhanced the story even though it weighed down the overall production with unnecessary clichés the plot is this the viking chief timandahaf is sick and tired of going to raid villages and then finding them emptied so he consults his wise man cryptograf whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs and cryptograf tells him that fear lends the villagers wings taking this literally timandahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly and sets out on an expedition to retrieve the champion of fear an expedition that of course leads him to the gaulish village where asterix and obelix live the pair are currently very frustrated chief vitalstatistix s cowardly pacifist nephew justforkix has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man and the boy is making little to no progress when justforkix unwittingly confesses to being afraid of everything in the presence of the brainless viking olaf he is believed to be the champion of fear and is kidnapped asterix and obelix are sent by vitalstatistix to go rescue justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home ultimately this is a great movie with few flaws besides the clichés and at times defective dialogs i thoroughly enjoyed it despite the fact that it wasn t true to the comic 
23,alright i have to admit that i have never seen rhoda and only one or two episodes of the mary tyler moore show even though i don t know anything about this duo of comedic talent i still liked this movie a lot mary goes back to work rose tries her luck at being a comedian rhoda struggles with a photography career and meredith what exactly does she do again these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way when the two long time friends reunite it only makes the film better i was surprised about how good the writing was the little jokes thrown in by mary and rhoda were funny the script itself was very well put together i had seen moore and harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie they never seem to let me down during the run of this movie joie lenz and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great the rest of the cast like jonah cecile and everybody else also works well together being that this is a reunion you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this from a non fan i still enjoyed this little get together good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good the newer version of the mtm theme song doesn t hurt either 
521, lies tells about an affair between an 18 year old bucktoothed female student and a scrawny 38 year old married man with the pair of protags spending about half the screen time engaged in naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half meandering through the pathetically naive storyline which seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes with very poor production value including obvious sanitary appliances and phony softcore sex to a story which is a messy mix of comedy and drama lies quickly becomes redundant ad nauseam with an almost 2 hour run subtitles and so little substance lies is simply not recommendable c 
269,another one for the babes bullets crowd the story is much edgier than any other musical i have seen cannons hidden up the missing legs of females and places each generatively in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the locale more effective than contemporary drama it is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants in lue of leggage pretty remarkable if you consider the context despite the cannon up the leg thing providing 90 of the surprises this film also chronicles how greed supersedes all other considerations in the lives of a group of yakuzas who pursue a woman who keeps up her leg a concealed cannon rocket launcher hence no group shower scenes or thongs the hidden projectile launcher which is pulled out from the behind the protagonists back seemingly from nowhere in miike s dead or alive 1999 the torch brought forth out of thin air by the heroine towards the end of the original tomie 2000 or the harrowing flame thrower scene in sunny gets blue 1992 all testify to an almost third world cantinflas esquire influence in the contemporary japanese cinema of which i am at a loss to explain but cannot complain you won t see good quality movies of this essence made in hollywood its all but extinct and with cheap crap they pump out for a cheap thrill is all but laughable this is a true film and while its great in its entirety the ending is a brilliant if not unblatant rip off of certain sergio leon pictures involving cannons where legs should be and certainly is appropriate 
922,why has this not been released i kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn t been how wrong can a girl be this film is in a word enthralling you will be captivated it holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows the final part of the film the episode as it were not giving anything away you saw that in the trailer is also unmissable you will chose a favourite you will be shocked you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens the adrenalin rises and you cant not watch cudos to the actors it s very believable and it doesn t stop there they have a final shock for you it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch and how far away from this are we really endemol who make big brother made a tv show in holland last year offering a dying woman s kidney to patients in need of a transplant the show was revealed at the end to be a hoax ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation but are we getting too close for comfort 
374,well this is a typical straight to the toilet slasher film long story short a bunch of teenagers young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage naked women teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky gory death scenes the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff but never bra less a creepy crazy man who knows about the evil lesbian kiss scene sex being a killer no ploteven then for a cheesy slasher film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead nothing not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold give the demonic 0 10 
666, ninja iii is not quite as bad as enter the ninja the first part of this trilogy but it s still a very bad movie it will hardly please the fans of martial arts movies because there isn t enough action but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence as if the film wasn t already weak enough the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic the exorcist rip off the only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the dominated heroine she is a beautiful and athletic woman which the director doesn t forget to exploit in various sleazy ways she just happens to be an aerobics teacher i don t mind a little soft core exploitation but it must not pretend to be something else 
26,final fantasy advent children is and will remain a classic example of style over substance gone wrong instead of drawing upon the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game square enix has churned out a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes yes i said incomprehensible did you know that tifa knows blindingly fast kung fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second that cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in midair for a full minute while wildly swinging away with his 2 ton sword the english dub is mediocre while not egregiously bad it is far from well produced the quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub here is what i d like to say to the die hard ffvii fans who can t stop gushing over this movie advent children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from square enix but even a trashy cg flick like galerians rion had a better story you ll be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought in due time the days of its novelty are numbered movies like advent children make me question whether square enix recognizes the potential of its franchises after all and no offense it s a japanese company japanese developers can deliver fun games but most of their offerings are disappointingly shallow they are utter psychos however when it comes to production quality advent children features some of the most breathtaking renders in cg history but that doesn t save it from its convoluted plot and cardboard characters any fan who followed this film knows sephiroth comes back bending the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake note the one point i give this film is in honor of the 10 000 enslaved japanese animators who gave their lives to render each bleached blond hair on cloud s effeminate caucasian head 
826,i remember loving this show when i was a kid i thought the helicopter was the coolest thing i ve seen it was ultra high tech for it s time it could repel enemy fire do all sorts of acrobatics in the air and take down nearly anything in it s way now i go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is the casts members are hardly compelling there are a lot of cheesy moments and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking and nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage lot of the footages appear to date from the vietnam war era airwolf has basically the same theme as knight rider except the crime fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car after watching a few episodes i found myself utterly bored i do however love the theme music 
112,crispin glovers way of acting and not only his is tremendous you really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect he gives layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult as well as feck which role is done very well by dennis hopper it s about choosing the right or wrong side without logical thinking about the scene friendship is more imported and that s exactly what i think is what makes choices this difficult rivers edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers i really enjoyed it watching i saw it a month ago for the first time but if you like a nice 80s feel this is the one that you have to see i ts a same that i didn t know of it earlier 
331,i m in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of pirated movies this gem came along with 11 other movies and this is easily the worst i ve seen in a long time i ve seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn t take itself too seriously but really i think that s a cover up for the fact that its horrible it s not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you haven t seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you ll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to cliché visual ie opening credits to the adobe premier special effects they couldn t even get blanks for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if you re going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin don t let stunt folk act they can t also the comment about this being a return of old vampire movies no it s not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire slayer blade underworld they re all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the newest vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid 33 cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because it s better than i could do of course i also know i can t make movies so i don t try i do know how to watch movies though i work 12 hour nights 6 days a week i ve seen several thousand in the year i ve been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack 
53,i first watched kindred in 1987 along with another movie called devouring waves i remember back then i hated them both and i have never really bothered to watch them again however i have recently started a crusade to collect as many 80 s horror titles in their original boxed form that have been deleted for some time i have got myself quite a proud collection with many more titles on my list the kindred although i have not as yet got a copy is high priority as all the old movies i didn t like back then i now own and have now re watched and think they are brilliant and the bits i do remember of the kindred are now driving me to want to get hold of a copy a s a p hurray for the 80 s and long live horror 
709,one of the last classics of the french new wave for direction cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of early century cinema for story eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life so many things can be said of this film observationally brilliant self indulgently overlong occasionally hilarious emotionally draining etc etc in my mind whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths every film student writer or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts no music video overstyling no soap opera like plot twists and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie everything is to be admired the writing concise clever surprisingly funny acting everyone quite simply is perfect in their respective roles and simple direction the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film make this film unforgettable this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you 
626,never when i was a child did i love any movie more then this one i would love to own it i watched it every sunday they played it on the family film festival it is an enjoyable film suitable for the whole family and the songs are wonderful 
910,there are good bad movies and bad bad movies and enjoyably bad movies this isn t one of them this is a movie that doesn t realize just how bad it is i saw this at a screening on november 14 2006 at the new beverly theater in los angeles as part of the grindhouse cinema this theater puts on every month hopefully presenters eric caiden co will think twice before letting writer director lawrenece foldes anywhere near them again what a con man the guy got up to speak before the film you would think he was orson welles talking about touch of evil or some other lost classic hardly nice of him to take up 20 minutes of the audiences time with his incoherent rambling young warriors has been described as a cross between animal house and death wish but if you are expecting something along the lines of imitations like revenge of the nerds or the exterminator you will be in for one sad disappointment the script makes zero sense the direction is so poor the actors looked embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is watching a car blow up poor richard shaft roundtree in this movie he plays another character with the first name of john but that s about the only similarity his character here has to the aforementioned classic i hope this film allowed him to pay the rent for another month other actors who look like they wished they could be anywhere else included ernest borgnine and linda day george this is a complete waste of time even the audience did not seem that into it except for the one spazz boy sitting in the back who yelled whoa every five minutes and his girlfriend who giggled with the fervor of a lobotomized talking barbie every time he opened his mouth for real films about vigilantes i would suggest the following death wish i ii iii exterminator i vigilante force ms 45 rolling thunder the no mercy man the latter two being a pair of films presented at this theater a couple of years ago probably the same budget as young warriors but both were a million times better :D
387,slash flicks come few and far between now a days so when i heard about cut i had high hopes and heard good things about it those good things i heard were all wrong very wrong this flick is bad and i mean bad it s just plain stupid everything about it especially the killer s origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end there is nothing original or outstanding about this flick just another slasher wannabe with those hip self aware movie savvy characters i m so sick of that crap someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood literally 
727,as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid at heart i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasn t been a good superhero movie out for quite some time note batman forever was not a good superhero movie i really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema read blair witch project i wasn t disappointed mystery men was definitely not a high effects tension filled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scene stiller and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william h macy plays a great straight man while kel mitchell and the fart powered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy though the sets are bizarre and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off guard and bring tears from the belly laughers among us i definitely recommend this movie although not an all time classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread the writing is good and the cast is great if you re worried plan on the matinee and pay less but either way you ll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesn t root for the losers once in a while 
226,the defining scene to this movie is when the fat guy quits but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty check on the dinosaurs keep in mind that he no longer has this job and so is absolutely not getting paid for this also keep in mind it s a goddamn dinosaur and the doctor he s supposed to trust is evil and doesn t like him but he s still like yeah okay that just defined the stupidity in this movie one melissa brasselle proves that seriously anyone can bolt on some breasts and be in movies i can go ride a mountain bike between them but hey aside from that the people of paraguay are very nice eric roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far there s no adjective to describe how bored he is throughout corbin bernsen saves what there is to save and you start rooting for him but they have to stick to the formula of course and i wonder how much your life sucks when you play like one of the army guys in this one how low can your acting career go the special effects are so embarrassingly bad you expect a sign saying studio 3 to get into the frame it s not even honest pulp it s all taken from carnosaur which even sucked all by itself and then i wonder why just anyone is allowed to make a movie 
994,a young girl surviving as a prostitute a cheap hustler who wants to get the big score they meet each other in thailand you may think by the opening titles it s going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life this film feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes of images but still refreshing this story is also about eros and thanatos it s not an original joke but it is well told says a character and that also applies to this one we ve seen the story but this way we see it thailand appears in hot tones the photograph going from one colored to a multicolored place and it captures the city as the cage of this imperfect persons there is also a good use of the music to dot the actions 
306,i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill jackie kennedy s sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the maysles to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women i d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating i e are they nuts or am i missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it facets does though 
92,grey gardens is shocking amusing sad and mesmerizing i watched in amazement as ediths jr and sr bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past their existence in a dilapidated mansion which they had not left for more than fifteen years is both a comedy and a tragedy this is a film you will not soon forget 
43,i love the music of the clash and i love the music of joe strummer and the mescaleros i went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that but i came out of the theatre not knowing much more about joe than i already did after reading the entry on wikipedia the movie never really gets through to the person his thoughts and feelings what they did was to collect the little material that they had shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about joe strummer at a camp fire it turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say oh he was such an inspiration to all of us like bono or johnny depp whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in pirates of the caribbean it seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart that ever lived sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him sure being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such but in the end i felt like what remained as the portrait of joe strummer could have easily been told in 60 90 minutes go see the movie if you are a fan otherwise better listen to some music of the clash or even better the undeservedly unknown mescaleros where joe strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound 
972,this is the first pepe le pew cartoon and in some ways it s very similar to the later ones but in a few other odd ways it is not while the object of pepe s affections is a cat oddly it appears to be a boy cat this whole predicament occurs because a cat is tired of being abused by others and dresses up like a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk so it can be left alone unfortunately this attracts our hero pepe most of the action is pretty typical until the very funny and unexpected ending and this actually makes this one of the best of all cartoons in the series excellent animation though the style is different than later examples excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this one a keeper 
235,this movie is the next segment in the pokemon movies which supplies everything on hopes and dreams of a pokemon warrior named ash ketchim and his friends they go out and they look battle and run into new pokemon and take on new adventures with pikachu and other pokemon favorites this adventure takes on with a new pokemon called celebi a time pokemon go join ash brock and misty to find all sorts of new things 
146,make up your own mind personally i found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from stevie wonder no offense mr wonder maybe it is comedy but i just found it stupid not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids wheeler seann william scott and danny paul rudd two energy drink salesmen to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by gayle sweeny jane lynch one of the misfits is ronnie bobb e j thompson a foul mouthed fifth grader and the other is augie christopher mintz plasse a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world wheeler and danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life love and heavy metal lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies supporting are elizabeth banks ken jeongg kerri kenney silver amanda righetti and david wain 
606,whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the 19th century libby and george were married for 12 years until the little big horn what s not known to today s audience is that libby survived until 1933 during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing but if done from libby s point of view they could be understood and forgiven sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer he was retired and replaced by george b mcclellan in late 1861 while custer was still at west point i m not sure they ever met but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema errol flynn and olivia dehavilland this was the last of eight films they did together the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libby s farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign both their performances olivia s especially was a high point in their careers at warner brothers we know through history that custer is riding to his doom that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy if your eyes don t moisten you are made of marble as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action you can t beat this film at all 
442,this isn t a very good movie but it is easily the best troma studios film i have ever viewed lloyd kaufman the brains behind troma isn t concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film his chief concern is making something bizarre and his definition of bizarre oftentimes mirrors my definition of terrible cinema in this film we have the titled character luther whose favorite pastime isn t baseball but biting the heads off of chickens receiving his release from lockup the board has deemed him rehabilitated despite the fact that he doesn t speak he merely clucks like a chicken and has a set of razorblade dentures at his disposal of course once luther is set free he goes about causing mayhem first at a grocery store and later at a farm house violence lots of violence in this oftentimes tasteless flick luther sinks his razorblade chompers into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter at the farmhouse nudity stacy haiduk delivers some noteworthy skin in his picture as the former lois lane i can t recall which superman edition she was from gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend a guy who just doesn t have any chemistry with ms haiduk the extended shower scene footage in the dvd extras gives the viewer quite a bit more of stacy she is quite something story forgettaboutit whitey styles screenplay may just be the worst ever written the way in which luther is released from the asylum completely throws all credibility out the window his dialogue is something that a pre schooler might write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd it s as if styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations acting the film belongs to edward terry who actually does a decent job as the geek he is quite menacing in a stupid barnyard fashion joan roth as the mother does a super job in support but haiduk and her boyfriend s lack of chemistry made their roles awkward at best 
571,i watched this film awhile ago and the only thing i can remember about the film is how absolutely horribly outstandingly bad it was its definitely in my top 5 worst films i have ever seen and to think i had to persuade my mates to get this film out at the video shop my reputation has been shot to bits because of this film will my mates ever trust me again i doubt it they always say don t judge something by its cover they were right when i saw the cover to skins gang boys i thought wow this looks great as it had a load of skin heads on the front cover running riot with metal bars don t watch this film i can t think of anything else to say the acting is bad the story is bad its just bad 
738,the film made no sense to me whatsoever good actors sergiocastellittoaparticular favourite he was great in uomo dellestelle thestarmaker but that was made by giuseppe tornatore a great italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort but awful rambling script terrible editing and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say and ended up saying exactly nothing apretentious load of rubbish but the sort of film that certain italianpseudo intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it and unfortunately italy has no monopoly on these they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece i never thought much of bellochio as director i remember seeing his first film pugninella tasca fists in the pocket or some such title in rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago i was living thereat the time all the usual pseudos raved about it but it left me pretty cold i didn t think he was much of a director then and still don t age has certainly not improved him and this film must rank as one of his worst 
0,this anime series starts out great interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not everything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the sci fi thriller giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho babble and quasi religious preachy exploitation if you want to hear you re ok it s good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good sci fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy 
551,this is the movie that pretty much sounded the death knell for the auteur in hollywood at over 40 million bucks heaven s gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure what really galls me the most about it is that technically it s very bad an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it john hurt s commencement speech at harvard is inaudible as is a conversation between kris kristofferson and richard masur at the train station some people seem to think cimino intended this as a style he didn t it s just bad sound recording the characters are not particularly well drawn except for the four or five leads in the climactic battle scene it s difficult to tell who s the bad guys and who s the good guys even on that level it s impossible to enjoy the movie the casting of isabelle huppert as the town madam is a joke her french accent renders the whole character a fraud the acting is generally stiff without any range or depth of feeling even christopher walken is bad john hurt s character is the only one with any swagger or vitality although hurt in his 40s playing a fresh faced harvard grad with bags under his eyes is patently ridiculous i guess to say that it s overlong is overkill the roller skating sequence could have been easily cut the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the twilight zone having rod serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale actually those scenes in and of themselves are not bad but cimino has not earned the right to include them because what he s given us as the meat of the picture is so incompetently bad the editing is poor especially in the grand battle climax at one point the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times i wish could i say something anything nice about this movie a great scene a great performance even one memorable line of dialogue but i can t it is all just one big unholy mess about the only thing i did like was the cinematography and the montana locations which are stunning even cimino couldn t screw that up this is a long boring bad movie by all standards and the people who say that it gets bashed only because of the cost overruns are just kidding themselves 1 2 out of 4
679,i ticked the contains spoiler box in case i say anything that is a spoiler and don t realise i ve said it until i re read it after i ve posted so it s just in case anyhow back to reviewing this film i saw this film on skymovies earlier on this afternoon and by the description sky gives you these people must be on acid it sounded pretty good but then when i actually got about 30 minutes into it i was appalled this film in my opinion has the worst scriptwriting and actors actresses ever the young girl who falls in love with the boy from l a after about 3 hours is a really stupid lame character who has an annoying whiney voice and boff hair then there s her lover who s an idiot and is also very whiney actually maybe they suit each other then there s the boy s mum who s with him on holiday and surprise surprise she s a doctor and oh my god wait there s even more unsuspected surprises a virus suddenly breaks out on the island and she knows all about viruses o shock horror yeah right lol then there s this insane religious lad who keeps going on about erbs or something and how the lord knows all everyone on the island seems to love him yet he s actually a stubborn arrogant steroid pumped you really need to watch this film just for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a swim his head is like tiny and his body is massive it s hilarious buffoon who s had way too much to drink anyhow after all these weirdo characters including a stoned looking taxi driver the religious lad finally gives in to the doctor and she takes a blood sample and they get straight to work on finding the cure from that because for some reason he s dramatically been saved all down to erbs and god and oh my god yes there s another surprise you ll never guess what just in the nick of time with 11 minutes to go before everybody on the island drops dead in fact including her son and his girl she finds the cure and injects everybody and it s all resolved what a pathetic film i mean i knew it sounded an obvious ending from when i first started watching it but i actually though it d be good and have some sub plot twists somewhere but no no it was just boring and dry don t watch this film you ll end up like me stunned for 3 hours and then demanding the hour and a half you spent of your life watching it back 
829,the film looks like as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorists it should actually be called dino crap there is nothing good about this movie even the actors are not worth a penny don t waste your time watching this movie the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie i mean isn t he ashamed of looking at peoples faces after they have seen his movie the dinocroc looks as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut and paste stuff and its the same old story man plays god creates some creature it escapes and is happy eating people and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt has to come and kill it bla bla u will figure out the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
283,this show is terrible i cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains this is not entertaining improvisational acting it s just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene i have actually done improv work as an actor and this show is not improv what the audience is actually laughing at if they re actually laughing at this show at all it looks quite fake is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in headlights the dumb completely unrelated things they come up with are what people laugh at and if it s not part of the scene the actors will tell them that it s wrong i find this show is disgrace to the art and makes me cry for shows like whose line is it anyway which had great talent great improv games and on top of everything else didn t make me want to change the channel 
241,we expected something great when we went to see this bomb it is basically a broadway play put on film the music is plain terrible there isn t one memorable song in the movie heard any hits from this movie you won t because there aren t any some of the musical numbers go on so long that i got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when i got back if they were good songs well but they suck the pace is slow terrible character development the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song it was almost impossible to stand this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die hard broadway enthusiasts this is without a doubt the most over rated movie i ve seen in my entire life a complete waist of time and money there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover who wasn t on screen enough and whose character wasn t developed enough rent the video and you ll agree this movie was an expensive over produced polished dog do 
356,i have seen all the film interpretations of hamlet from sir lawrence olivier to mel gibson gasp derek jacobi captures the true essence of the character from the beginning to the brutal climax superb acting all around this one should not be missed 
305,in the early to mid 1970 s clifford irving proposed to write the ultimate biography of howard hughes claiming to have spent months preparing for the book engaged in interviews with the reclusive millionaire when all of this turned out to be false irving was accused of perjury spent several years behind bars although always admitting his findings were accurate flash forward to 20001 several months prior to september 11th a book entitled forbidden love published in the u s as honor lost love and death in modern day jordan by a previously unknown author by the name of norma khouri a woman from jordan who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend dalia due to the fact that dalia being from a devout muslim background was dating a christian man it like irving s biography on hughes was revealed as a potential hoax australian film maker anna broinowski attempts to delve into the quagmire that was khouri s attempts to clear herself of the lie s over the time frame of 104 minutes the film attempts to reveal is norma khouri telling the truth or is she just a compulsive liar with an agenda vendetta of her own interview footage with those who know knew her including an ex husband her publisher and others tell their side of the story this is a toothsome well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties not rated but contains pervasive bad language a re enactment of the grisly murder scene played over a few times but nothing nearly as graphic disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic such as saw part 84 not a good choice for the little ones :P
496,ok this movie was the worst display i have seen in years the actors weren t to bad i figured it was a b movie so they were doing b movie acting anyways i watched this movie thinking oh cool a ufo sci fi movie wrong it was just an excuse for radical christians to push a message onto people the last scene was extremely messed up that is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something what someone believe in is a matter of opinion this movie just shows how corrupted religion is especially christianity if you want to watch a b movie this ain t if you want to watch a movie that is trying to brainwash the masses well this is the pick of the litter go right for it if you are going to convey a message do it don t force it ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such a degree especially christians 
667,watching film i was in very light mood and also this film is light but the end of the film is just unexpected which leaves a long lasting memories in one s mind movie starts with abhay and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesn t leaving soha alone on to the street she cant go back home and she don t have any thing to live on here in this situation abahy turns out to be a helper for her this is the base of story the rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that abhay has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seat dialogues and music are good songs are ok direction is good and so as the screenplay you do feel that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story it is all right a truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts my rating for this is 8 10
