MLflow Plugins
==============

As a framework-agnostic tool for machine learning, the MLflow Python API provides developer APIs for
writing plugins that integrate with different ML frameworks and backends.

Plugins provide a powerful mechanism for customizing the behavior of the MLflow
Python client and integrating third-party tools, allowing you to:

- Integrate with third-party storage solutions for experiment data, artifacts, and models
- Integrate with third-party authentication providers, e.g. read HTTP authentication credentials
  from a special file
- Use the MLflow client to communicate with other REST APIs, e.g. your organization's existing
  experiment-tracking APIs
- Automatically capture additional metadata as run tags, e.g. the git repository associated with a run
- Add new backend to execute MLflow Project entrypoints.

The MLflow Python API supports several types of plugins:

* **Tracking Store**: override tracking backend logic, e.g. to log to a third-party storage solution
* **ArtifactRepository**: override artifact logging logic, e.g. to log to a third-party storage solution
* **Run context providers**: specify context tags to be set on runs created via the
  :py:func:`mlflow.start_run` fluent API.
* **Model Registry Store**: override model registry backend logic, e.g. to log to a third-party storage solution
* **MLFlow Project backend**: override the local execution backend to execute a project on your own cluster (Databricks, kubernetes, etc.)

Using an MLflow Plugin
----------------------

MLflow plugins are Python packages that you can install using PyPI or conda.
This example installs a Tracking Store plugin from source and uses it within an example script.

Install the Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started, clone MLflow and install `this example plugin <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/tests/resources/mlflow-test-plugin>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow
  cd mlflow
  pip install -e tests/resources/mlflow-test-plugin


Run Code Using the Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This plugin defines a custom Tracking Store for tracking URIs with the ``file-plugin`` scheme.
The plugin implementation delegates to MLflow's built-in file-based run storage. To use
the plugin, you can run any code that uses MLflow, setting the tracking URI to one with a
``file-plugin://`` scheme:

.. code-block:: bash

  MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=file-plugin:$(PWD)/mlruns python examples/quickstart/mlflow_tracking.py

Launch the MLflow UI:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ..
  mlflow server --backend-store-uri ./mlflow/mlruns


View results at http://localhost:5000. You should see a newly-created run with a param named
"param1" and a metric named "foo":

Writing Your Own MLflow Plugins
-------------------------------

Defining a Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You define an MLflow plugin as a standalone Python package that can be distributed for
installation via PyPI or conda. See https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/branch-1.5/tests/resources/mlflow-test-plugin for an
example package that implements all available plugin types.

The example package contains a ``setup.py`` that declares a number of
`entry points <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins>`_:

.. code-block:: python

    setup(
        name="mflow-test-plugin",
        # Require MLflow as a dependency of the plugin, so that plugin users can simply install
        # the plugin and then immediately use it with MLflow
        install_requires=["mlflow"],
        ...
        entry_points={
            # Define a Tracking Store plugin for tracking URIs with scheme 'file-plugin'
            "mlflow.tracking_store": "file-plugin=mlflow_test_plugin.file_store:PluginFileStore",
            # Define a ArtifactRepository plugin for artifact URIs with scheme 'file-plugin'
            "mlflow.artifact_repository":
                "file-plugin=mlflow_test_plugin.local_artifact:PluginLocalArtifactRepository",
            # Define a RunContextProvider plugin. The entry point name for run context providers
            # is not used, and so is set to the string "unused" here
            "mlflow.run_context_provider": "unused=mlflow_test_plugin.run_context_provider:PluginRunContextProvider",
            # Define a Model Registry Store plugin for tracking URIs with scheme 'file-plugin'
            "mlflow.model_registry_store":
                "file-plugin=mlflow_test_plugin.sqlalchemy_store:PluginRegistrySqlAlchemyStore",
            # Define a MLflow Project Backend plugin called 'dummy-backend'
            "mlflow.project_backend":
                "dummy-backend=mlflow_test_plugin.dummy_backend:PluginDummyProjectBackend",
        },
    )

Each element of this ``entry_points`` dictionary specifies a single plugin. You
can choose to implement one or more plugin types in your package, and need not implement them all.
The type of plugin defined by each entry point and its corresponding reference implementation in
MLflow are described below. You can work from the reference implementations when writing your own
plugin:

     - Entry-point group
     - Entry-point name and value
     - Reference Implementation
   * - Plugins for overriding definitions of tracking APIs like ``mlflow.log_metric``, ``mlflow.start_run`` for a specific
       tracking URI scheme.
     - mlflow.tracking_store
     - The entry point value (e.g. ``mlflow_test_plugin.local_store:PluginFileStore``) specifies a custom subclass of

Testing Your Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend testing your plugin to ensure that it follows the contract expected by MLflow. For
example, a Tracking Store plugin should contain tests verifying correctness of its
``log_metric``, ``log_param``, ... etc implementations. See also the tests for MLflow's
reference implementations as an example:

* `Example Tracking Store tests <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-1.5/tests/store/tracking/test_file_store.py>`_
* `Example ArtifactRepository tests <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-1.5/tests/store/artifact/test_local_artifact_repo.py>`_
* `Example RunContextProvider tests <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-1.5/tests/tracking/context/test_git_context.py>`_
* `Example Model Registry Store tests <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-1.5/tests/store/model_registry/test_sqlalchemy_store.py>`_


Distributing Your Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming you've structured your plugin similarly to the example plugin, you can `distribute it
via PyPI <https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/>`_.

Congrats, you've now written and distributed your own MLflow plugin!


Community Plugins
-----------------


SQL Server Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The `mlflow-dbstore plugin <https://pypi.org/project/mlflow-dbstore/>`_ allows MLflow to use a relational database as an artifact store.
As of now, it has only been tested with SQL Server as the artifact store.

You can install MLflow with the SQL Server plugin via: 

.. code-block:: bash

        pip install mlflow[sqlserver] 

and then use MLflow as normal. The SQL Server artifact store support will be provided automatically.

The plugin implements all of the MLflow artifact store APIs. To use SQL server as an artifact store, a database URI must be provided, as shown in the example below:

.. code-block:: python

        db_uri = "mssql+pyodbc://username:password@host:port/database?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server"

        client.create_experiment(exp_name, artifact_location=db_uri)
        mlflow.set_experiment(exp_name)

        mlflow.onnx.log_model(onnx, "model")

The first time an artifact is logged in the artifact store, the plugin automatically creates an ``artifacts`` table in the database specified by the database URI and stores the artifact there as a BLOB. 
Subsequent logged artifacts are stored in the same table.

In the example provided above, the ``log_model`` operation creates three entries in the database table to store the ONNX model, the MLmodel file
and the conda.yaml file associated with the model.
