MLflow Documentation
====================

MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.
It tackles four primary functions:

* Tracking experiments to record and compare parameters and results (:ref:`tracking`).
* Packaging ML code in a reusable, reproducible form in order to share with other data
  scientists or transfer to production (:ref:`projects`).
* Managing and deploying models from a variety of ML libraries to a variety of model serving and
  inference platforms (:ref:`models`).
* Providing a central model store to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model,
  including model versioning, stage transitions, and annotations (:ref:`registry`).

MLflow is library-agnostic. You can use it with any machine learning library, and in any
programming language, since all functions are accessible through a :ref:`rest-api`
and :ref:`CLI<cli>`. For convenience, the project also includes a :ref:`python-api`, :ref:`R-api`, 
and :ref:`java_api`.

Get started using the :ref:`quickstart` or by reading about the :ref:`key concepts<concepts>`.
