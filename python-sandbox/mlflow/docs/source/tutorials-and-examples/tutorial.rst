Tutorial
========

This tutorial showcases how you can use MLflow end-to-end to:

- Train a linear regression model
- Package the code that trains the model in a reusable and reproducible model format
- Deploy the model into a simple HTTP server that will enable you to score predictions

This tutorial uses a dataset to predict the quality of wine based on quantitative features
like the wine's "fixed acidity", "pH", "residual sugar", and so on. The dataset
is from UCI's `machine learning repository <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality>`_.

What You'll Need
----------------

To run this tutorial, you'll need to:

.. plain-section::

    .. container:: python

       - Install MLflow and scikit-learn. There are two options for installing these dependencies:

           1. Install MLflow with extra dependencies, including scikit-learn
              (via ``pip install mlflow[extras]``)
           2. Install MLflow (via ``pip install mlflow``) and install scikit-learn separately
              (via ``pip install scikit-learn``)

       - Install `conda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_
       - Clone (download) the MLflow repository via ``git clone https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow``
       - ``cd`` into the ``examples`` directory within your clone of MLflow - we'll use this working
         directory for running the tutorial. We avoid running directly from our clone of MLflow as doing
         so would cause the tutorial to use MLflow from source, rather than your PyPI installation of
         MLflow.

    .. container:: R

       - Install `conda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_
       - Install the MLflow package (via ``install.packages("mlflow")``)
       - Install MLflow (via ``mlflow::install_mlflow()``)
       - Clone (download) the MLflow repository via ``git clone https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow``
       - ``setwd()`` into the ``examples`` directory within your clone of MLflow - we'll use this
         working directory for running the tutorial. We avoid running directly from our clone of
         MLflow as doing so would cause the tutorial to use MLflow from source, rather than your
         PyPI installation of MLflow.

Training the Model
------------------


First, train a linear regression model that takes two hyperparameters: ``alpha`` and ``l1_ratio``.

.. plain-section::

  .. container:: python

    The code is located at ``examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py`` and is reproduced below.
    
    .. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py

    This example uses the familiar pandas, numpy, and sklearn APIs to create a simple machine learning
    model. The :doc:`MLflow tracking APIs<../tracking/>` log information about each
    training run, like the hyperparameters ``alpha`` and ``l1_ratio``, used to train the model and metrics, like
    the root mean square error, used to evaluate the model. The example also serializes the
    model in a format that MLflow knows how to deploy.

    You can run the example with default hyperparameters as follows:

    .. code-block:: py

        python examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py

    Try out some other values for ``alpha`` and ``l1_ratio`` by passing them as arguments to ``train.py``:

    .. code-block:: py

        python examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py <alpha> <l1_ratio>

    Each time you run the example, MLflow logs information about your experiment runs in the directory ``mlruns``.

    .. note::
        If you would like to use the Jupyter notebook version of ``train.py``, try out the tutorial notebook at ``examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.ipynb``.

  .. container:: R

    The code is located at ``examples/r_wine/train.R`` and is reproduced below.

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/r_wine/train.R

    This example uses the familiar ``glmnet`` package to create a simple machine learning
    model. The :doc:`MLflow tracking APIs<../tracking/>` log information about each
    training run, like the hyperparameters ``alpha`` and ``lambda``, used to train the model and metrics, like
    the root mean square error, used to evaluate the model. The example also serializes the
    model in a format that MLflow knows how to deploy.

    You can run the example with default hyperparameters as follows:

    .. code-block:: R

        mlflow_run(uri = "examples/r_wine", entry_point = "train.R")

    Try out some other values for ``alpha`` and ``lambda`` by passing them as arguments to ``train.R``:

    .. code-block:: R

        mlflow_run(uri = "examples/r_wine", entry_point = "train.R", parameters = list(alpha = 0.1, lambda = 0.5))

    Each time you run the example, MLflow logs information about your experiment runs in the directory ``mlruns``.

    .. note::
        If you would like to use an R notebook version of ``train.R``, try the tutorial notebook at ``examples/r_wine/train.Rmd``.

Comparing the Models
--------------------


Next, use the MLflow UI to compare the models that you have produced. In the same current working directory 
as the one that contains the ``mlruns`` run:

.. code-section::
    .. code-block:: python

        mlflow ui
    .. code-block:: R

        mlflow_ui()

and view it at http://localhost:5000.

On this page, you can see a list of experiment runs with metrics you can use to compare the models.

.. plain-section::

  .. container:: python

    .. image:: ../_static/images/tutorial-compare.png

  .. container:: R

      .. image:: ../_static/images/tutorial-compare-R.png

You can  use the search feature to quickly filter out many models. For example, the query ``metrics.rmse < 0.8``
returns all the models with root mean squared error less than 0.8. For more complex manipulations,
you can download this table as a CSV and use your favorite data munging software to analyze it.


.. _conda-example:

Packaging Training Code in a Conda Environment
----------------------------------------------

Now that you have your training code, you can package it so that other data scientists can easily reuse the model, or so that you can run the training remotely, for example on Databricks.

.. plain-section::

    .. container:: python

      You do this by using :doc:`../projects` conventions to specify the dependencies and entry points to your code. The ``sklearn_elasticnet_wine/MLproject`` file specifies that the project has the dependencies located in a `Conda environment file <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-file-manually>`_
      called ``conda.yaml`` and has one entry point that takes two parameters: ``alpha`` and ``l1_ratio``.

      .. code-block:: yaml

          # sklearn_elasticnet_wine/MLproject

          name: tutorial

          conda_env: conda.yaml

          entry_points:
            main:
              parameters:
                alpha: float
                l1_ratio: {type: float, default: 0.1}
              command: "python train.py {alpha} {l1_ratio}"


      The Conda file lists the dependencies:

      .. code-block:: yaml

          # sklearn_elasticnet_wine/conda.yaml

          name: tutorial
          channels:
            - defaults
          dependencies:
            - numpy=1.14.3
            - pandas=0.22.0
            - scikit-learn=0.19.1
            - pip:
              - mlflow

      To run this project, invoke ``mlflow run examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine -P alpha=0.42``. After running
      this command, MLflow runs your training code in a new Conda environment with the dependencies
      specified in ``conda.yaml``.

      If the repository has an ``MLproject`` file in the root you can also run a project directly from GitHub. This tutorial is duplicated in the https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-example repository
      which you can run with ``mlflow run https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-example.git -P alpha=5``.

    .. container:: R

      You do this by running ``mlflow_snapshot()`` to create an `R dependencies packrat file <https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/>`_ called ``r-dependencies.txt``.

      The R dependencies file lists the dependencies:

      .. code-block:: r

          # examples/r_wine/r-dependencies.txt

          PackratFormat: 1.4
          PackratVersion: 0.4.9.3
          RVersion: 3.5.1
          Repos: CRAN=https://cran.rstudio.com/

          Package: BH
          Source: CRAN
          Version: 1.66.0-1
          Hash: 4cc8883584b955ed01f38f68bc03af6d

          Package: Matrix
          Source: CRAN
          Version: 1.2-14
          Hash: 521aa8772a1941dfdb007bf532d19dde
          Requires: lattice

          ...

      To run this project, invoke:

      .. code-block:: r

        mlflow_run("examples/r_wine", entry_point = "train.R", parameters = list(alpha = 0.2))

      After running this command, MLflow runs your training code in a new R session.

      To restore the dependencies specified in ``r-dependencies.txt``, you can run instead:

      .. code-block:: r

        mlflow_restore_snapshot()
        mlflow_run("examples/r_wine", entry_point = "train.R", parameters = list(alpha = 0.2))

      You can also run a project directly from GitHub. This tutorial is duplicated in the https://github.com/rstudio/mlflow-example repository which you can run with:

      .. code-block:: r

        mlflow_run(
          "train.R",
          "https://github.com/rstudio/mlflow-example",
          parameters = list(alpha = 0.2)
        )

Serving the Model
-----------------

Now that you have packaged your model using the MLproject convention and have identified the best model,
it is time to deploy the model using :doc:`../models`. An MLflow Model is a standard format for
packaging machine learning models that can be used in a variety of downstream tools â€” for example,
real-time serving through a REST API or batch inference on Apache Spark.

In the example training code, after training the linear regression model, a function
in MLflow saved the model as an artifact within the run.

.. plain-section::

    .. container:: python

      .. code-block:: py

          mlflow.sklearn.log_model(lr, "model")

      To view this artifact, you can use the UI again. When you click a date in the list of experiment
      runs you'll see this page.

      .. image:: ../_static/images/tutorial-artifact.png

      At the bottom, you can see that the call to ``mlflow.sklearn.log_model`` produced two files in
      ``/Users/mlflow/mlflow-prototype/mlruns/0/7c1a0d5c42844dcdb8f5191146925174/artifacts/model``.
      The first file, ``MLmodel``, is a metadata file that tells MLflow how to load the model. The
      second file, ``model.pkl``, is a serialized version of the linear regression model that you trained.

      In this example, you can use this MLmodel format with MLflow to deploy a local REST server that can serve predictions.

      To deploy the server, run (replace the path with your model's actual path):

      .. code-block:: bash

          mlflow models serve -m /Users/mlflow/mlflow-prototype/mlruns/0/7c1a0d5c42844dcdb8f5191146925174/artifacts/model -p 1234

      .. note::

          The version of Python used to create the model must be the same as the one running ``mlflow models serve``.
          If this is not the case, you may see the error
          ``UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0x9f in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)``
          or ``raise ValueError, "unsupported pickle protocol: %d"``.

      Once you have deployed the server, you can pass it some sample data and see the
      predictions. The following example uses ``curl`` to send a JSON-serialized pandas DataFrame
      with the ``split`` orientation to the model server. For more information about the input data
      formats accepted by the model server, see the
      :ref:`MLflow deployment tools documentation <local_model_deployment>`.

      .. code-block:: bash

          curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json; format=pandas-split" --data '{"columns":["alcohol", "chlorides", "citric acid", "density", "fixed acidity", "free sulfur dioxide", "pH", "residual sugar", "sulphates", "total sulfur dioxide", "volatile acidity"],"data":[[12.8, 0.029, 0.48, 0.98, 6.2, 29, 3.33, 1.2, 0.39, 75, 0.66]]}' http://127.0.0.1:1234/invocations

      the server should respond with output similar to::

          [6.379428821398614]

    .. container:: R

      .. code-block:: r

          mlflow_log_model(predictor, "model")

      To view this artifact, you can use the UI again. When you click a date in the list of experiment
      runs you'll see this page.

      .. image:: ../_static/images/tutorial-artifact-r.png

      At the bottom, you can see that the call to ``mlflow_log_model()`` produced two files in
      ``mlruns/0/c2a7325210ef4242bd4631cec8f92351/artifacts/model/``.
      The first file, ``MLmodel``, is a metadata file that tells MLflow how to load the model. The
      second file, ``r_model.bin``, is a serialized version of the linear regression model that you trained.

      In this example, you can use this MLmodel format with MLflow to deploy a local REST server that can serve predictions.

      To deploy the server, run:

      .. code-block:: r

          mlflow_rfunc_serve(model_uri="mlruns/0/c2a7325210ef4242bd4631cec8f92351/artifacts/model", port=8090)

      This initializes a REST server and opens a `Swagger <https://swagger.io/>`_ interface to perform predictions against
      the REST API:

      .. image:: ../_static/images/tutorial-serving-r.png

      .. note::

          By default, a model is served using the R packages available. To ensure the environment serving
          the prediction function matches the model, set ``restore = TRUE`` when calling
          ``mlflow_rfunc_serve()``.

      To serve a prediction, enter this in the Swagger UI::

        {
          "fixed acidity": 6.2,
          "volatile acidity": 0.66,
          "citric acid": 0.48,
          "residual sugar": 1.2,
          "chlorides": 0.029,
          "free sulfur dioxide": 29,
          "total sulfur dioxide": 75,
          "density": 0.98,
          "pH": 3.33,
          "sulphates": 0.39,
          "alcohol": 12.8
        }

      which should return something like::

        [
          [
            6.4287492410792
          ]
        ]

      Or run:

      .. code-block:: bash

          curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8090/predict/" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"fixed acidity\": 6.2, \"volatile acidity\": 0.66, \"citric acid\": 0.48, \"residual sugar\": 1.2, \"chlorides\": 0.029, \"free sulfur dioxide\": 29, \"total sulfur dioxide\": 75, \"density\": 0.98, \"pH\": 3.33, \"sulphates\": 0.39, \"alcohol\": 12.8}"

      the server should respond with output similar to::

        [[6.4287492410792]]
