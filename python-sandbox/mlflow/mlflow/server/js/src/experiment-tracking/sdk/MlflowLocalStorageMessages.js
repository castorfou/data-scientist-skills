/**
 * This class contains definitions of message entities corresponding to data stored in LocalStorage.
 * The backwards-compatibility behavior of these messages is as follows:
 *
 * Backwards-compatible changes:
 * 1) Adding a new field: Backwards-compatible. New fields that are absent from old data in
 *    local storage will take on the specified default value.
 * 2) Removing a field: Backwards-compatible. Unknown fields from old data in local storage will be
 *    ignored at construction-time.
 *
 * Backwards-incompatible changes (AVOID MAKING SUCH CHANGES):
 * 1) Changing the type of a field. Old data loaded from local storage will be of the wrong type.
 * 2) Changing the role/usage of a field. It's better to add a new field than to repurpose an
 *    existing field, since a repurposed field may be populated with unexpected data cached in
 *    local storage.
