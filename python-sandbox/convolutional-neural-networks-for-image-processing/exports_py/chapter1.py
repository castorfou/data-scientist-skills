# ## Images as data: visualizations
# To display image data, you will rely on Python's Matplotlib library, and specifically use matplotlib's pyplot sub-module, that contains many plotting commands. Some of these commands allow you to display the content of images stored in arrays.

# ## Images as data: changing images
# To modify an image, you can modify the existing numbers in the array. In a color image, you can change the values in one of the color channels without affecting the other colors, by indexing on the last dimension of the array.
# 
# The image you imported in the previous exercise is available in data.
