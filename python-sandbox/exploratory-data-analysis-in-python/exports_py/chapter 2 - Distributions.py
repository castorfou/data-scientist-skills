# # Comparing distributions

# # Modeling distributions
# 
# ```python
# # The normal distribution
# sample = np.random.normal(size=1000)
# Cdf(sample).plot()
# 
# # The normal CDF
# from scipy.stats import norm
# xs = np.linspace(-3, 3)
# ys = norm(0, 1).cdf(xs)
# plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray')
# Cdf(sample).plot()
# 
# # The bell curve
# xs = np.linspace(-3, 3)
# ys = norm(0,1).pdf(xs)
# plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray')
# 
# # KDE plot
# import seaborn as sns
# sns.kdeplot(sample)
# 
# 
# ```
# 
# PMF, CDF, KDE
# Use CDFs for exploration.
# Use PMFs if there are a small number of unique values.
# Use KDE if there are a lot of values.

# ## Distribution of income
# > 
# > In many datasets, the distribution of income is approximately lognormal, which means that the logarithms of the incomes fit a normal distribution. We'll see whether that's true for the GSS data. As a first step, you'll compute the mean and standard deviation of the log of incomes using NumPy's `np.log10()` function.
# > 
# > Then, you'll use the computed mean and standard deviation to make a `norm` object using the [`scipy.stats.norm()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.html) function.

# In[24]:


import numpy as np

# Extract realinc and compute its log
income = gss['realinc']
log_income = np.log10(income)

# Compute mean and standard deviation
mean = log_income.mean()
std = log_income.std()
print(mean, std)

# Make a norm object
from scipy.stats import norm
dist = norm(mean,std)


# ## Comparing CDFs
# > 
# > To see whether the distribution of income is well modeled by a lognormal distribution, we'll compare the CDF of the logarithm of the data to a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation. These variables from the previous exercise are available for use:
# > 
# >     # Extract realinc and compute its log
# >     log_income = np.log10(gss['realinc'])
# >     
# >     # Compute mean and standard deviation
# >     mean, std = log_income.mean(), log_income.std()
# >     
# >     # Make a norm object
# >     from scipy.stats import norm
# >     dist = norm(mean, std)
# >     
# > 
# > `dist` is a `scipy.stats.norm` object with the same mean and standard deviation as the data. It provides `.cdf()`, which evaluates the normal cumulative distribution function.
# > 
# > Be careful with capitalization: `Cdf()`, with an uppercase `C`, creates `Cdf` objects. `dist.cdf()`, with a lowercase `c`, evaluates the normal cumulative distribution function.

# In[25]:


# Evaluate the model CDF
xs = np.linspace(2, 5.5)
ys = dist.cdf(xs)

# Plot the model CDF
plt.clf()
plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray')

# Create and plot the Cdf of log_income
Cdf(log_income).plot()
    
# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('log10 of realinc')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.show()


# ## Comparing PDFs
# > 
# > In the previous exercise, we used CDFs to see if the distribution of income is lognormal. We can make the same comparison using a PDF and KDE. That's what you'll do in this exercise!
# > 
# > As before, the `norm` object `dist` is available in your workspace:
# > 
# >     from scipy.stats import norm
# >     dist = norm(mean, std)
# >     
# > 
# > Just as all `norm` objects have a `.cdf()` method, they also have a `.pdf()` method.
# > 
# > To create a KDE plot, you can use Seaborn's [`kdeplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.kdeplot.html) function. To learn more about this function and Seaborn, you can check out DataCamp's [Data Visualization with Seaborn](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-seaborn) course. Here, Seaborn has been imported for you as `sns`.
