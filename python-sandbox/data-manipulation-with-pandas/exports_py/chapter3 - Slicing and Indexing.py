# 
# > ## Subsetting with .loc\[\]
# > 
# > The killer feature for indexes is `.loc[]`: a subsetting method that accepts index values. When you pass it a single argument, it will take a subset of rows.
# > 
# > The code for subsetting using `.loc[]` can be easier to read than standard square bracket subsetting, which can make your code less burdensome to maintain.
# > 
# > `pandas` is loaded as `pd`. `temperatures` and `temperatures_ind` are available; the latter is indexed by `city`.

# > -   Create a list called `cities` that contains "Moscow" and "Saint Petersburg".
# > -   Use `[]` subsetting to filter `temperatures` for rows where the `city` column takes a value in the `cities` list.
# > -   Use `.loc[]` subsetting to filter `temperatures_ind` for rows where the city is in the `cities` list.

# In[9]:


# Make a list of cities to subset on

# [Setting multi-level indexes | Python](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas/slicing-and-indexing?ex=4)
# 
# > ## Setting multi-level indexes
# > 
# > Indexes can also be made out of multiple columns, forming a _multi-level index_ (sometimes called a _hierarchical index_). There is a trade-off to using these.
# > 
# > The benefit is that multi-level indexes make it more natural to reason about nested categorical variables. For example, in a clinical trial, you might have control and treatment groups. Then each test subject belongs to one or another group, and we can say that a test subject is nested inside the treatment group. Similarly, in the temperature dataset, the city is located in the country, so we can say a city is nested inside the country.
# > 
# > The main downside is that the code for manipulating indexes is different from the code for manipulating columns, so you have to learn two syntaxes and keep track of how your data is represented.
# > 
# > `pandas` is loaded as `pd`. `temperatures` is available.

# > -   Set the index of `temperatures` to the `"country"` and `"city"` columns, and assign this to `temperatures_ind`.
# > -   Specify two country/city pairs to keep: `"Brazil"`/`"Rio De Janeiro"` and `"Pakistan"`/`"Lahore"`, assigning to `rows_to_keep`.
# > -   Print and subset `temperatures_ind` for `rows_to_keep` using `.loc[]`.

# 
# > ## Slicing index values
# > 
# > Slicing lets you select consecutive elements of an object using `first:last` syntax. DataFrames can be sliced by index values or by row/column number; we'll start with the first case. This involves slicing inside the `.loc[]` method.
# > 
# > Compared to slicing lists, there are a few things to remember.
# > 
# > -   You can only slice an index if the index is sorted (using `.sort_index()`).
# > -   To slice at the outer level, `first` and `last` can be strings.
# > -   To slice at inner levels, `first` and `last` should be tuples.
# > -   If you pass a single slice to `.loc[]`, it will slice the rows.

# > `pandas` is loaded as `pd`. `temperatures_ind` has country and city in the index, and is available.

# 
# > ## Slicing in both directions
# > 
# > You've seen slicing DataFrames by rows and by columns, but since DataFrames are two-dimensional objects, it is often natural to slice both dimensions at once. That is, by passing two arguments to `.loc[]`, you can subset by rows and columns in one go.

# 
# > ## Slicing time series
# > 
# > Slicing is particularly useful for time series since it's a common thing to want to filter for data within a date range. Add the `date` column to the index, then use `.loc[]` to perform the subsetting. The important thing to remember is to keep your dates in ISO 8601 format, that is, `yyyy-mm-dd`.
# > 
# > Recall from Chapter 1 that you can combine multiple Boolean conditions using logical operators (such as `&`). To do so in one line of code, you'll need to add parentheses `()` around each condition.
# > 
# > `pandas` is loaded as `pd` and `temperatures`, with no index, is available.

# > -   Use Boolean conditions (not `.isin()` or `.loc[]`) to subset for rows in 2010 and 2011, and print the results.
# >     -   _Note that because the date isn't set as an index, a condition that contains only a year, such as `df["date"] == "2009"`, will check if the date is equal to the first day of the first month of the year (e.g. `2009-01-01`), rather than checking whether the date occurs within the given year. We recommend writing out the full date when using Boolean conditions (e.g., `2009-12-31`)._
