# ## Calculating probabilities
# 
# You're in charge of the sales team, and it's time for performance reviews, starting with Amir. As part of the review, you want to randomly select a few of the deals that he's worked on over the past year so that you can look at them more deeply. Before you start selecting deals, you'll first figure out what the chances are of selecting certain deals.
# 
# Recall that the probability of an event can be calculated by
# 
# $ P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{# ways event can happen}}{\text{total # of possible outcomes}} $

# > ## Creating a probability distribution
# > 
# > A new restaurant opened a few months ago, and the restaurant's management wants to optimize its seating space based on the size of the groups that come most often. On one night, there are 10 groups of people waiting to be seated at the restaurant, but instead of being called in the order they arrived, they will be called randomly. In this exercise, you'll investigate the probability of groups of different sizes getting picked first. Data on each of the ten groups is contained in the `restaurant_groups` DataFrame.
# > 
# > Remember that expected value can be calculated by multiplying each possible outcome with its corresponding probability and taking the sum. The `restaurant_groups` data is available. `pandas` is loaded as `pd`, `numpy` is loaded as `np`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` is loaded as `plt`.

# 
# > ## Data back-ups
# > 
# > The sales software used at your company is set to automatically back itself up, but no one knows exactly what time the back-ups happen. It is known, however, that back-ups happen exactly every 30 minutes. Amir comes back from sales meetings at random times to update the data on the client he just met with. He wants to know how long he'll have to wait for his newly-entered data to get backed up. Use your new knowledge of continuous uniform distributions to model this situation and answer Amir's questions.

# > To model how long Amir will wait for a back-up using a continuous uniform distribution, save his lowest possible wait time as `min_time` and his longest possible wait time as `max_time`. Remember that back-ups happen every 30 minutes.

# In[32]:


# Min and max wait times for back-up that happens every 30 min
min_time = 0
max_time = 30


# > Import `uniform` from `scipy.stats` and calculate the probability that Amir has to wait less than 5 minutes, and store in a variable called `prob_less_than_5`.

# In[33]:


# Import uniform from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Calculate probability of waiting less than 5 mins
prob_less_than_5 = uniform.cdf(5, min_time, max_time)
print(prob_less_than_5)


# > Calculate the probability that Amir has to wait more than 5 minutes, and store in a variable called `prob_greater_than_5`.

# In[34]:


# Calculate probability of waiting more than 5 mins
prob_greater_than_5 = 1-prob_less_than_5
print(prob_greater_than_5)


# > Calculate the probability that Amir has to wait between 10 and 20 minutes, and store in a variable called `prob_between_10_and_20`.

# In[35]:


# Calculate probability of waiting 10-20 mins
prob_between_10_and_20 = uniform.cdf(20, min_time, max_time)-uniform.cdf(10, min_time, max_time)

# 
# > ## Simulating sales deals
# > 
# > Assume that Amir usually works on 3 deals per week, and overall, he wins 30% of deals he works on. Each deal has a binary outcome: it's either lost, or won, so you can model his sales deals with a binomial distribution. In this exercise, you'll help Amir simulate a year's worth of his deals so he can better understand his performance.
# > 
# > `numpy` is imported as `np`.

# > Import `binom` from `scipy.stats` and set the random seed to 10.

# In[40]:


# Import binom from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import binom

# Set random seed to 10
np.random.seed(10)


# > Simulate 1 deal worked on by Amir, who wins 30% of the deals he works on.

# In[41]:


# Simulate a single deal
print(binom.rvs(1, 0.3, size=1))


# > Simulate a typical week of Amir's deals, or one week of 3 deals.

# In[43]:


# Simulate 1 week of 3 deals
print(binom.rvs(3, 0.3, size=1))


# > -   Simulate a year's worth of Amir's deals, or 52 weeks of 3 deals each, and store in `deals`.
# > -   Print the mean number of deals he won per week.

# In[44]:


# Simulate 52 weeks of 3 deals

# > 
# > `binom` is imported from `scipy.stats`.

# > What's the probability that Amir closes all 3 deals in a week? Save this as `prob_3`.

# In[45]:


# Probability of closing 3 out of 3 deals
prob_3 = binom.pmf(3, 3, 0.3)

print(prob_3)


# > What's the probability that Amir closes 1 or fewer deals in a week? Save this as `prob_less_than_or_equal_1`.

# In[46]:


# Probability of closing <= 1 deal out of 3 deals
prob_less_than_or_equal_1 = binom.cdf(1, 3, 0.3)

# > ## How many sales will be won?
# > 
# > Now Amir wants to know how many deals he can expect to close each week if his win rate changes. Luckily, you can use your binomial distribution knowledge to help him calculate the expected value in different situations. Recall from the video that the expected value of a binomial distribution can be calculated by $n \times p$.

# > -   Calculate the expected number of sales out of the **3** he works on that Amir will win each week if he maintains his 30% win rate.
# > -   Calculate the expected number of sales out of the 3 he works on that he'll win if his win rate drops to 25%.
# > -   Calculate the expected number of sales out of the 3 he works on that he'll win if his win rate rises to 35%.

# In[49]:


# Expected number won with 30% win rate

print(won_30pct)

# Expected number won with 25% win rate
