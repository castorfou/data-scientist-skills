# ## Finding consistency
# > 
# > In this exercise and throughout this chapter, you'll be working with the `airlines` DataFrame which contains survey responses on the San Francisco Airport from airline customers.
# > 
# > The DataFrame contains flight metadata such as the airline, the destination, waiting times as well as answers to key questions regarding cleanliness, safety, and satisfaction. Another DataFrame named `categories` was created, containing all correct possible values for the survey columns.
# > 
# > In this exercise, you will use both of these DataFrames to find survey answers with inconsistent values, and drop them, effectively performing an outer and inner join on both these DataFrames as seen in the video exercise. The `pandas` package has been imported as `pd`, and the `airlines` and `categories` DataFrames are in your environment.

# ## Inconsistent categories
# > 
# > In this exercise, you'll be revisiting the `airlines` DataFrame from the previous lesson.
# > 
# > As a reminder, the DataFrame contains flight metadata such as the airline, the destination, waiting times as well as answers to key questions regarding cleanliness, safety, and satisfaction on the San Francisco Airport.
# > 
# > In this exercise, you will examine two categorical columns from this DataFrame, `dest_region` and `dest_size` respectively, assess how to address them and make sure that they are cleaned and ready for analysis. The `pandas` package has been imported as `pd`, and the `airlines` DataFrame is in your environment.

# In[9]:


# Print unique values of both columns
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())


# In[10]:


# Lower dest_region column and then replace "eur" with "europe"

airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].replace({'eur':'europe'})


# In[11]:


# Remove white spaces from `dest_size`
airlines['dest_size'] = airlines['dest_size'].str.strip()

# Verify changes have been effected
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())


# ## Remapping categories
# > 
# > To better understand survey respondents from `airlines`, you want to find out if there is a relationship between certain responses and the day of the week and wait time at the gate.
# > 
# > The `airlines` DataFrame contains the `day` and `wait_min` columns, which are categorical and numerical respectively. The `day` column contains the exact day a flight took place, and `wait_min` contains the amount of minutes it took travelers to wait at the gate. To make your analysis easier, you want to create two new categorical variables:
# > 
# > -   `wait_type`: `'short'` for 0-60 min, `'medium'` for 60-180 and `long` for 180+
# > -   `day_week`: `'weekday'` if day is in the weekday, `'weekend'` if day is in the weekend.
# > 
# > The `pandas` and `numpy` packages have been imported as `pd` and `np`. Let's create some new categorical data!

# [Remapping categories | Python](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python/text-and-categorical-data-problems?ex=7)
# 
# > -   Create the ranges and labels for the `wait_type` column mentioned in the description above.
# > -   Create the `wait_type` column by from `wait_min` by using `pd.cut()`, while inputting `label_ranges` and `label_names` in the correct arguments.
# > -   Create the `mapping` dictionary mapping weekdays to `'weekday'` and weekend days to `'weekend'`.
# > -   Create the `day_week` column by using `.replace()`.

# 
# # Fixing the phone number column

# ## Removing titles and taking names
# > 
# > While collecting survey respondent metadata in the `airlines` DataFrame, the full name of respondents was saved in the `full_name` column. However upon closer inspection, you found that a lot of the different names are prefixed by honorifics such as `"Dr."`, `"Mr."`, `"Ms."` and `"Miss"`.
# > 
# > Your ultimate objective is to create two new columns named `first_name` and `last_name`, containing the first and last names of respondents respectively. Before doing so however, you need to remove honorifics.
# > 
# > The `airlines` DataFrame is in your environment, alongside `pandas` as `pd.`

# [Removing titles and taking names | Python](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python/text-and-categorical-data-problems?ex=9)
# 
# > -   Remove `"Dr."`, `"Mr."`, `"Miss"` and `"Ms."` from `full_name` by replacing them with an empty string `""` in that order.
# > -   Run the `assert` statement using `.str.contains()` that tests whether `full_name` still contains any of the honorifics.

# ## Keeping it descriptive
# > 
# > To further understand travelers' experiences in the San Francisco Airport, the quality assurance department sent out a qualitative questionnaire to all travelers who gave the airport the worst score on all possible categories. The objective behind this questionnaire is to identify common patterns in what travelers are saying about the airport.
# > 
# > Their response is stored in the `survey_response` column. Upon a closer look, you realized a few of the answers gave the shortest possible character amount without much substance. In this exercise, you will isolate the responses with a character count higher than **_40_** , and make sure your new DataFrame contains responses with **_40_** characters or more using an `assert` statement.
# > 
# > The `airlines` DataFrame is in your environment, and `pandas` is imported as `pd`.

# [Keeping it descriptive | Python](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python/text-and-categorical-data-problems?ex=10)

# > -   Using the `airlines` DataFrame, store the length of each instance in the `survey_response` column in `resp_length` by using `.str.len()`.
# > -   Isolate the rows of `airlines` with `resp_length` higher than `40`.
# > -   Assert that the smallest survey response length in `airlines_survey` is now bigger than 40.
