# # Calculating probabilities of two events
# 

# ## Measuring a sample
# Let's work with a sample of coin flips to calculate some probabilities. You will calculate absolute and relative frequency and check the theoretical value from the distribution of the sample data.
# 
# The array sample_of_two_coin_flips has 1,000 experiments, each consisting of two fair coin flips. For each experiment, we record the number of heads out of the two coin flips: 0, 1, or 2.
# 
# We've preloaded the binom object and the find_repeats() and relfreq() methods from the scipy.stats library for you. You'll need these to calculate the probabilities in this exercise.
