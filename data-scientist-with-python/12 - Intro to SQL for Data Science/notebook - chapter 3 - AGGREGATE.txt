Arithmetic
	the following gives a result of 1:
	SELECT (4 / 3);
	SQL assumes that if you divide an integer by an integer, you want to get an integer back. 

	If you want more precision when dividing, you can add decimal places to your numbers. For example,
	SELECT (4.0 / 3.0) AS result;
	gives you the result you would expect: 1.333.
