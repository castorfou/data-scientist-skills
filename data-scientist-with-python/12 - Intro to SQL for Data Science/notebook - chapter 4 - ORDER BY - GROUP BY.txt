GROUP BY
		GROUP BY allows you to group a result by one or more columns, like so:

		SELECT sex, count(*)
		FROM employees
		GROUP BY sex
		ORDER BY count DESC;

		SELECT release_year, AVG(duration) FROM films
		GROUP BY release_year
		;
		
HAVING
	if you want to filter based on the result of an aggregate function, you need another way! That's where the HAVING clause comes in. For example,
		SELECT release_year
		FROM films
		GROUP BY release_year
		HAVING COUNT(title) > 10;
