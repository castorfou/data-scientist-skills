WHERE 
	In SQL, the WHERE keyword allows you to filter based on both text and numeric values in a table. There are a few different comparison operators you can use:

		= equal
		<> not equal
		< less than
		> greater than
		<= less than or equal to
		>= greater than or equal to

BETWEEN
	--It's important to remember that BETWEEN is inclusive, meaning the beginning and end values are included in the results!			
		SELECT title
		FROM films
		WHERE release_year
		BETWEEN 1994 AND 2000;
	
NULL and IS NULL
	--to count the number of missing birth dates in the people table:
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM people
		WHERE birthdate IS NULL;

	--this query gives the names of all people whose birth dates are not missing in the people table.
		SELECT name
		FROM people
		WHERE birthdate IS NOT NULL;

LIKE and NOT LIKE
	--The % wildcard will match zero, one, or many characters in text. 
		SELECT name
		FROM companies
		WHERE name LIKE 'Data%';

	--The _ wildcard will match a single character. 
		SELECT name
		FROM companies
		WHERE name LIKE 'DataC_mp';

	You can also use the NOT LIKE operator to find records that don't match the pattern you specify.
