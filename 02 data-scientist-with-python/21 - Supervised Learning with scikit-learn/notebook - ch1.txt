The Iris dataset in scikit-learn

	from sklearn import datasets
	import pandas as pd
	mport numpy as np
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	plt.style.use('ggplot')
	iris = datasets.load_iris()
	type(iris)
	Out[7]: sklearn.datasets.base.Bunch
	print(iris.keys())
	dict_keys(['data', 'target_names', 'DESCR', 'feature_names', 'target'])
	
	
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
	In [12]: X = iris.data
	In [13]: y = iris.target
	In [14]: df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=iris.feature_names)
	
Visual EDA
	In [16]: _ = pd.scatter_matrix(df, c = y, figsize = [8, 8], s=150, marker = 'D')
	
sns.countplot

	However, you may have noticed in the previous exercise that all the features in this dataset are binary; that is, they are either 0 or 1. So a different type of plot would be more useful here, such as Seaborn's countplot.

	Given on the right is a countplot of the 'education' bill, generated from the following code:

	plt.figure()
	sns.countplot(x='education', hue='party', data=df, palette='RdBu')
	plt.xticks([0,1], ['No', 'Yes'])
	plt.show()

Scikit-learn fit and predict
? All machine learning models implemented as Python classes
? They implement the algorithms for learning and predicting
? Store the information learned from the data
? Training a model on the data = ‘fi"ing’ a model to the data
? .fit() method
? To predict the labels of new data: .predict() method	


Using scikit-learn to fit a classifier

Exercise - 	k-Nearest Neighbors: Fit

Having explored the Congressional voting records dataset, it is time now to build your first classifier. In this exercise, you will fit a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier to the voting dataset, which has once again been pre-loaded for you into a DataFrame df.

In the video, Hugo discussed the importance of ensuring your data adheres to the format required by the scikit-learn API. The features need to be in an array where each column is a feature and each row a different observation or data point - in this case, a Congressman's voting record. The target needs to be a single column with the same number of observations as the feature data. We have done this for you in this exercise. Notice we named the feature array X and response variable y: This is in accordance with the common scikit-learn practice.

Your job is to create an instance of a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors (by specifying the n_neighbors parameter) and then fit it to the data. The data has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame called df.

		# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
		from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

		# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
		y = df['party'].values
		X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

		# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors
		knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

		# Fit the classifier to the data
		knn.fit(X, y)

Exercise - k-Nearest Neighbors: Predict

Having fit a k-NN classifier, you can now use it to predict the label of a new data point. However, there is no unlabeled data available since all of it was used to fit the model! You can still use the .predict() method on the X that was used to fit the model, but it is not a good indicator of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

In the next video, Hugo will discuss a solution to this problem. For now, a random unlabeled data point has been generated and is available to you as X_new. You will use your classifier to predict the label for this new data point, as well as on the training data X that the model has already seen. Using .predict() on X_new will generate 1 prediction, while using it on X will generate 435 predictions: 1 for each sample.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded as df. This time, you will create the feature array X and target variable array y yourself.

		# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
		from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 

		# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
		y = df['party'].values
		X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

		# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors: knn
		knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

		# Fit the classifier to the data
		knn.fit(X, y)

		# Predict the labels for the training data X
		y_pred = knn.predict(X)

		# Predict and print the label for the new data point X_new
		new_prediction = knn.predict(X_new)
		print("Prediction: {}".format(new_prediction))
		
Great work! Did your model predict 'democrat' or 'republican'? How sure can you be of its predictions? In other words, how can you measure its performance? This is what you will learn in the next video.


Measuring model performance - Train/test split

	from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
	X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test =train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=21, stratify=y)
	knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=8)
	knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
	y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
	print("Test set predictions:\n {}".format(y_pred))
		Test set predictions:
		[2 1 2 2 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 1 0 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 0 0
		1 2 2 0 0 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 0 2 1]
	knn.score(X_test, y_test)
		Out[7]: 0.9555555555555556
		
Exercise - The digits recognition dataset

Up until now, you have been performing binary classification, since the target variable had two possible outcomes. Hugo, however, got to perform multi-class classification in the videos, where the target variable could take on three possible outcomes. Why does he get to have all the fun?! In the following exercises, you'll be working with the MNIST digits recognition dataset, which has 10 classes, the digits 0 through 9! A reduced version of the MNIST dataset is one of scikit-learn's included datasets, and that is the one we will use in this exercise.

Each sample in this scikit-learn dataset is an 8x8 image representing a handwritten digit. Each pixel is represented by an integer in the range 0 to 16, indicating varying levels of black. Recall that scikit-learn's built-in datasets are of type Bunch, which are dictionary-like objects. Helpfully for the MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an 'images' key in addition to the 'data' and 'target' keys that you have seen with the Iris data. Because it is a 2D array of the images corresponding to each sample, this 'images' key is useful for visualizing the images, as you'll see in this exercise (for more on plotting 2D arrays, see Chapter 2 of DataCamp's course on Data Visualization with Python). On the other hand, the 'data' key contains the feature array - that is, the images as a flattened array of 64 pixels.

Notice that you can access the keys of these Bunch objects in two different ways: By using the . notation, as in digits.images, or the [] notation, as in digits['images'].

For more on the MNIST data, check out this exercise in Part 1 of DataCamp's Importing Data in Python course. There, the full version of the MNIST dataset is used, in which the images are 28x28. It is a famous dataset in machine learning and computer vision, and frequently used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of a new model.

		# Import necessary modules
		from sklearn import datasets
		import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

		# Load the digits dataset: digits
		digits = datasets.load_digits()

		# Print the keys and DESCR of the dataset
		print(digits.keys())
		print(digits.DESCR)

		# Print the shape of the images and data keys
		print(digits.images.shape)
		print(digits.data.shape)

		# Display digit 1010
		plt.imshow(digits.images[1010], cmap=plt.cm.gray_r, interpolation='nearest')
		plt.show()

Good job! It looks like the image in question corresponds to the digit '5'. Now, can you build a classifier that can make this prediction not only for this image, but for all the other ones in the dataset? You'll do so in the next exercise!

Exercise - Train/Test Split + Fit/Predict/Accuracy

Now that you have learned about the importance of splitting your data into training and test sets, it's time to practice doing this on the digits dataset! After creating arrays for the features and target variable, you will split them into training and test sets, fit a k-NN classifier to the training data, and then compute its accuracy using the .score() method.

		# Import necessary modules
		from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
		from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

		# Create feature and target arrays
		X = digits.data
		y = digits.target

		# Split into training and test set
		X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

		# Create a k-NN classifier with 7 neighbors: knn
		knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=7)

		# Fit the classifier to the training data
		knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

		# Print the accuracy
		print(knn.score(X_test, y_test))

Excellent work! Incredibly, this out of the box k-NN classifier with 7 neighbors has learned from the training data and predicted the labels of the images in the test set with 98% accuracy, and it did so in less than a second! This is one illustration of how incredibly useful machine learning techniques can be.

Exercise - Overfitting and underfitting

Remember the model complexity curve that Hugo showed in the video? You will now construct such a curve for the digits dataset! In this exercise, you will compute and plot the training and testing accuracy scores for a variety of different neighbor values. By observing how the accuracy scores differ for the training and testing sets with different values of k, you will develop your intuition for overfitting and underfitting.

The training and testing sets are available to you in the workspace as X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test. In addition, KNeighborsClassifier has been imported from sklearn.neighbors.

		# Setup arrays to store train and test accuracies
		neighbors = np.arange(1, 9)
		train_accuracy = np.empty(len(neighbors))
		test_accuracy = np.empty(len(neighbors))

		# Loop over different values of k
		for i, k in enumerate(neighbors):
			# Setup a k-NN Classifier with k neighbors: knn
			knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)

			# Fit the classifier to the training data
			knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
			
			#Compute accuracy on the training set
			train_accuracy[i] = knn.score(X_train, y_train)

			#Compute accuracy on the testing set
			test_accuracy[i] = knn.score(X_test, y_test)

		# Generate plot
		plt.title('k-NN: Varying Number of Neighbors')
		plt.plot(neighbors, test_accuracy, label = 'Testing Accuracy')
		plt.plot(neighbors, train_accuracy, label = 'Training Accuracy')
		plt.legend()
		plt.xlabel('Number of Neighbors')
		plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
		plt.show()
		
Great work! It looks like the test accuracy is highest when using 3 and 5 neighbors. Using 8 neighbors or more seems to result in a simple model that underfits the data. Now that you've grasped the fundamentals of classification, you will learn about regression in the next chapter!
